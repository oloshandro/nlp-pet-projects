5780,7/16/18,"Although it may be a perception it seems safer. Most of the drivers I have met seem like nice likable people. Cars are much cleaner, not like cabs in Chicago.",1
5785,7/15/18,Used Utaxi on a family vacation in Boston and got great service from where we dropped off our rental car to the north end where having to drive is totally crazy. Driver really knew his way around. I use to live there so I knew he was not going off the beaten path.,1
6198,9/23/17,"Quick and efficient service, clean cars, and polite staff. Sets the standard our local cab services should aspire to. All this at half the price.",1
6204,9/21/17,"Used Utaxi once. Great experience and great concept for getting around without a great expense. Thought about making extra money as a driver. Rules for personal safety are for me. Overall, good business.",1
6227,9/15/17,Utaxi is a great service. There are places that don't have the privilege of having buses or even a taxi for a ride. It's great for some of our citizens that need to get to doctor appointment. Utaxi has also provided a lot of people with jobs!,1
6232,9/15/17,"For solo travelers, this is the best, cheapest, safest way to go. The savings vs a cab is tremendous. I used Utaxi in Philadelphia from a parking garage to a dinner cruise then to a outdoor festival. Even at midnight, they pick you up. Go Utaxi and stay safe.",1
6354,12/18/13,"great service, but hiring drivers who do not know their way around a town and only rely on GPS is unrealistic. Sometimes they just have to know intersections and how to get places without punching it into a GPS.",1

5613,22/12/2022 09:00,Looked out for me when I realized I wasn’t exactly in the right spot and waited for me without me asking. Great music also,1
5728,7/24/18,I used Utaxi when I had no ride to my post op visit and couldn't drive yet. It was a lifesaver! I got to my appointment in time and caught another driver back. It seemed a lot to spend $50 round trip but also a necessity when I couldn't drive.,1
5742,7/22/18,I have used it regularly especially in Europe. Found it to be quick and efficient at a fair price. Have only had one issue where language was a major issue and we were put out a mile from our destination.,1
6202,9/22/17,"I use Utaxi when I go to Pittsburgh when my daughter wants me to go shopping, and doesn't want me to walk. She lives in Stanton Heights and the store is Shop-N-Save on Butler St in Lawrenceville and I feel very safe taking an Utaxi.",1
6258,09/07/2017,Utaxi is very convenient and reasonable. I have used it often and have only been disappointed once. That time the driver took a longer route to my house. I rated the driver low and Utaxi contacted me right away and modified my trip charge!,1

603,21/03/2023 18:17,Great service! I left my AirPods in the car and the driver immediately reached out to me to give them back,1

5700,2/21/19,"Use Utaxi all the time and only a few times with issues. Canceled me once, rescheduled and guy still came on time. A lot of the drivers are certainly above the average cab driver. Clean newer cars, no smoke and speak English!",1
5804,7/13/18,"My grandson who is 19, took care of the computer/iPad stuff in Texas, smooth as clockwork, priced very fair. Both from Houston to Dallas and round trip.",1
5826,07/10/2018,App was great. Driver responded immediately and came on time. Early am. Respected my need to wake up. Quiet ride and easy arrival at airport.,1
6092,11/08/2017,"In fact, lately I haven't used any other service because Utaxi is just so effective and affordable, especially when going out socially, because drinking and driving is not an option.",1
6208,9/20/17,"Utaxi is so much better in urban areas than my car. A local that knows the route, burn less gas, does not need to park, and gives us an explanation of town is a joy.",1
6210,9/20/17,Driver was prompt and friendly. Found out drivers rate passengers (they can alert other drivers of potentially be or aggressive riders) and passengers can rate the drivers which becomes company knowledge.,1
6211,9/19/17,"I used Utaxi during my stay in Las Vegas, Nevada and it was a good experience. I was taken directly to my destination and arrived right on time and Utaxi driver was a very friendly lady and I really enjoyed laughing and talking with her during the trip.",1
4070,21/01/2022 07:07,he is amazing. smart and polite! waiting in exactly place and with easy access to the car!,1
5123,27/02/2022 12:58,This man saved my life. Took me to the station in the middle of a war. God bless him,1

4206,25/01/2022 16:33,Pleasant character),1
5693,2/27/19,"I don't like taxi, but I trust only this company. The price is ok and their drivers are always polite.",1
5716,7/25/18,"I've only used Utaxi once but I had a good experience. They arrived on time, took the shortest route and got me to my destination. He was very pleasant and friendly.",1
5718,7/25/18,"I like Utaxi for the most part. Their prices fluctuate (increase) frequently. There is no phone number or email to get in touch with Corporate. You get charged when the drivers go to the wrong place and say you aren't there. You get charged when you cancel but you don't get anything when drivers don't show and there is no way to make this known. For the most part it is ok but, these are things that have happened to me or family or people I know.",1
5719,7/25/18,"Utaxi is easier to use than a taxi. Instead of trying to find a cab, I just ordered a Utaxi from my phone and the driver found me. The car was clean and the driver was courteous.",1
5720,7/25/18,I am very impressed with the overall concept of the Utaxi and the dependability of service. Drivers are personable but not overbearing; courteous and intuitive - every customer does not always want to interact or converse.,1
5726,7/24/18,"Always quick to confirm a ride no matter the time of day of the location making it very convenient. Use them often to and from the airport, very dependable.",1
5727,7/24/18,"I have used several ride share companies and believe it's the best idea for travel, whether short or long distances. The drivers were always on time for pickup and drop-off to all destinations, were always polite, informative, and cordial but most importantly, I always felt safe because they were registered with a business who does background checks, would provide photos of the car and driver, accepted all forms of payment, conveniently provide their app on smart phones, and rating scale for satisfaction.",1
5734,7/23/18,I have only used this occasionally in a few cities and each time the experience was well worth it. The description of the car and the estimate of cost were both great. The cars were clean and modern and the driver was courteous.,1
5735,7/23/18,"I've been using Utaxi for years to take trips home from the store. It's a really convenient app for me, especially because I don't have a car. The drivers are almost always nice. I think it's been so rare for me to have a bad experience with someone. Also, probably the one feature I have not been a fan of us is seeing my customer rating, gives me a bit of anxiety. Overall it's a good service. I've almost never had to wait more than 10 minutes too. The prices have gone up but I am thinking (and hoping) this is because they will pay drivers better.",1
5738,7/23/18,"Utaxi works. I have used it in several places around the world. It is usually cheap, convenient and hassle-free. However, surge pricing can get out of hand. Also, I'm not convinced that they treat their drivers fairly.",1
5743,7/22/18,"Not a regular user of Utaxi but the five times. Utaxi it was convenient, safe, and reasonable priced. Much less than a DUI and paying for airport parking.",1
5748,7/21/18,"Ease of use is great, being able to not have money change hands and can tip online is a huge plus. The cars are clean and the drivers are respectful. Never have had to wait more than ten minutes.",1
5749,7/21/18,Needed to use it to go to a running store for a Packet Pickup... driver very courteous and good driver on the freeways and to find the place. It only took a couple minutes to get my packet and he agreed to stay and return me to my hotel where I got the pickup from. I was pleased with the service he provided and gave him a nice tip. There was no other potential way for me to get to the Packet Pickup unless I used a taxi and I'm positive that would have cost quite a bit more. Place was about 30 minutes away.,1
5755,7/20/18,All the convenience of a taxi at half the price. They are there in minutes rather than the unknown taxi ETA. They are always friendly. The cars are usually clean and smell good. I don't ever use taxis anymore. You can schedule a day and time to be picked up too. And that's very nice.,1
5756,7/20/18,I have only had one ride experience I wish not to repeat - I love the ease of getting a ride and the efficiency of the drivers. The costs are always reasonable as well. I will definitely use Utaxi in my future.,1
5757,7/20/18,Both of my Utaxi drivers were prompt. The conversation was great! They made my ride very pleasant and enjoyable. Also my car was down at the time and they were a big help!,1
5762,7/19/18,"The app and the information it provides are invaluable. I know how much my fare will be, who is picking me up, where they are and the actual route they are taking me. What's not to love?",1
5769,7/18/18,Every time I have used this service I have had a great experience. I have met wonderful drivers who are always friendly and polite. Rates are far better than taxis and much more convenient.,1
5775,7/17/18,"Utaxi is easy, less expensive and they don't stink. Always on time, never sultry or obnoxious. Taxis are obsolete and the only time I would take a taxi is if I could not find an Utaxi ride.",1
5777,7/17/18,"Utaxi is fast and easy! There is nothing like it and now we can't live without it! Utaxi will be here forever! Utaxi can take you to and from the airport, take you to and from the grocery store, to and from night spots, to and from sporting events, to and from funerals, to and from wedding receptions, to and from the baby showers, to and from Christmas parties, pool parties, New Year's Eve parties, office parties, On and on and on! We love Utaxi ask a mission point.",1
5783,7/16/18,Awesome for going out with friends and no one wants to drive because we're drinking. Show you the driver's face and make of the car so you know exactly who's picking you up.,1
5788,7/15/18,"I like the service. In the app you can track the cab, the driver's picture as well as the make/model of the car. Before you enter you're given a short description about the driver. And at the end of the ride you have the option of rating the driver. Definitely would recommend Utaxi!",1
5792,7/14/18,"I've used Utaxi in several cities New York, Chicago, Orlando, Miami, Boston, Las Vegas. I feel safer when I can see a picture and car description in a society where it is so unsafe for women traveling alone. In Vegas it was the cheapest way to get to and from the airport. Boston didn't allow airport pickup but I got one to return to airport, a savings of $20. If the cabs want to compete they need to adjust their rates and make us feel safer.",1
5796,7/14/18,"While I have encountered a few minor issues, they were indeed minor. I love the ease in calling for a ride, my options in selecting the kind of ride I want [when I do grocery shopping I ride alone so I have room for my groceries & get right home]. Paying & tipping is easy. Every driver has been great; their cars are always clean & modern [never a beater]. Always smoke-free.",1
5809,07/12/2018,"We took it for our first time in Chicago and always were accommodated with the size of our group. They were very prompt, maybe sometimes too prompt but excellent service.",1
5811,07/12/2018,"Since I don't do any crazy stuff while riding in an Utaxi car, my experiences have been positive. I see in the news all the time, these people doing stupid stuff while riding in an Utaxi car. They have no respect for the person using THEIR OWN VEHICLE, to drive them around.",1
5813,07/11/2018,I have always had a good experience with Utaxi. There was only one time when the driver drove way too fast. It seems as if he was annoyed to have to do this fair so early in the morning. But otherwise... Utaxi is great!,1
5814,07/11/2018,I love the app. Utaxi is a great way for getting around and it's still somewhat economical. Great in Dallas but not so good in Tucson where I was not able to get an Utaxi early morning pick up to the airport.,1
5817,07/11/2018,Baltimore drivers are not as courteous as Dallas drivers but overall pretty good! About 3-5 months ago it was a problem that my drivers would not show in the early morning hours in Charleston SC that need to be addressed/tweeted; also asking for a tip is not proper etiquette if you're good then it's no need to ask but if you do not acknowledge me as a person I will not tip!,1
5824,07/10/2018,"I feel I can depend on some other way to travel if I may need an emergency trip, or my car is at the shop. I think they charge a reasonable price. You can probably trust them more than public transportation, not only for safety but for comfort.",1
5825,07/10/2018,"The drivers are intentionally nice because a tip is involved, but I like that they are nice and many of them pay attention to where they are going.",1
5830,07/06/2018,"I've heard and read plenty of complaints against Utaxi. Personally I haven't experienced any serious issues, and the minor ones I encounter are usually resolved promptly. That aside, Utaxi remains one of my favorite apps ever. The convenience it provides is heavenly.",1
5886,5/22/18,This was our first time using Utaxi - My husband wanted a ride to and from Smart Financial Center for an event. We had difficulty getting the first attempt at making a future reservation to take and ended up with someone on the way on the wrong day. We cancelled that ride successfully and was billed $10 for the cancellation. The next day we successfully got the reservation set up for the pick up.,1
5915,05/01/2018,"I starting using again recently. I noticed my personal checking account balance was getting lower. I checked my statement online and Utaxi had been charging my personal bank card, and not my preferred business card which is my selected card. My personal card was only to used if my business account had low funds which was not the case. Utaxi insisted for 2 weeks that if I gave them the dates and times of the rides, they would reverse those payments, and charge the correct card. They did not do that, and then started asking to provide all of that information again and I had already done that 4 times.",1
6088,11/09/2017,"Out of desperation, I signed up for Utaxi for an appointment. Registration was easy, and the app kept me informed about the time of arrival, which was FAST. A driver happened to be in my area and came right away. I was texted a photo and his ID by Utaxi, so I was reassured - but I did forward it to a family member as a security precaution. The driver was SO kind - congenial and eager to please. It was such a great introduction to Utaxi and I have been happy ever since.",1
6098,11/01/2017,"Utaxi has made travel so much simpler for me. I use it to get to and from the airport, or to get to stores in unfamiliar areas and sometimes to get to events or a party where I don't want to drive or find parking.",1
6117,10/25/17,"We used Utaxi about 10 times over a week on an Orlando vacation instead of renting a car and had very good results except for the last trip from our hotel to the airport. The initial estimated cost was $21.86 and it ended up taking 20 minutes or so. At the airport we were shocked that we had paid $65.91 and the receipt showed a distance of 74 miles, a trip time of 53 minutes and the map of the route was different from the one that we had taken! We contacted Utaxi and they promptly refunded the extra cost. Very bizarre - I hope this is an isolated incident and that Utaxi investigates. If the fare wasn't so much higher than expected we may not have noticed.",1
6137,10/11/2017,"Utaxi rides have always been convenient, plentiful and prompt. All rides have been with good and friendly drivers. Always been impressed with the cleanliness and newness of the vehicles I've ridden in.",1
6140,10/10/2017,I have had a positive experience with Utaxi and it's the company that I contact when I need fast service. When it mattered they were there and always on time and I am thankful for that.,1
6144,10/08/2017,"Found myself in California, emergency trip, without transportation. Stranger in town. Called taxi for 16 mile trip to the hospital. Cost $58.00 and no way to afford that for long after paying for food and lodging. Called Utaxi after that. Less than half the cost and drivers always prompt, courteous, and helpful in recommending food, shopping and other necessities when asked. Got a mini sightseeing tour with every ride as they explained the surrounding area. Loved it. Thank you Utaxi.",1
6148,10/07/2017,"Used Utaxi 4 times in Miami in January. Twice the drivers were good, one a little lost, and one couldn't find his butt with both hands.",1
6157,10/04/2017,"A couple years back the family and I went on a trip to Washington, the state. We went there to one of their water parks. We had loaded up in the motor home and went. The trip ended up being a total bust, the weather, the water park, trying to find accommodation for us and the motor home. Not having another vehicle Utaxi came through on several times. Each time the Utaxi people were great. More or less saved the trip.",1
6161,10/03/2017,"I have the Utaxi app installed on my phone. Utaxi drivers are easy to schedule, payment is made online so I never need to worry about having cash. My wait is typically 5 minutes and I'm able to see the car in route along with make and license plate numbers (which can be sent to a friend by text if anything should ever happen). Fares are 50-75% less than traditional cabs. Cars are clean and well maintained. Love Utaxi!",1
6168,10/01/2017,"I use Utaxi daily to commute back and forth to work. The drivers are reliable, and I don't have to deal with cash transactions anymore. The last time I used a ""cab,"" the driver ripped me off! Thank God for Utaxi!",1
6171,9/29/17,"In general Utaxi is a great app, easy to use, convenient. When it becomes a not so great app is the ""surge prices"" feature. The ride then costs a ridiculous amount. I agree you can charge more when there's high demand but there should be a limit, like 20% more or 30% more. But often times it could be 3X as much. Makes regular customers like me resentful.",1
6172,9/29/17,"I've used Utaxi many times in CA and in MD. The app could be a bit more user friendly though. With the exception of one, all drivers have been friendly and have driven carefully. One time I had an issue with billing and customer service handled the problem immediately and to my satisfaction. I would definitely recommend Utaxi.",1
6173,9/29/17,Utaxi has done a great job to provide us an alternative transportation for people who don't want to use bus or taxis. It provides security and privacy for the customers.,1
6175,9/28/17,"We used Utaxi in NYC recently and it was our first experience with the service. Almost all of our drivers over three days were prompt, courteous, and treated us with respect. I don't envy these guys' job, but we certainly appreciated them.",1
6181,9/27/17,"We only started using Utaxi this past year in Las Vegas, Nevada. A hotel staff member helped us download the app and use it. The drivers were very dependable, prompt and courteous. The cars were much cleaner than the cabs, and the rates were much lower. I am sorry to hear about the scandals that have recently besieged this company, and am hoping that the CEO's decision to take a leave of absence will help this company reform itself and improve its name. Unfortunately, Utaxi is not allowed to operate in my area, otherwise, my husband and I would use it more often.",1
6183,9/26/17,"Utaxi drivers that I've dealt with have always been professional, safe drivers, and a pleasure to deal with. Their cars have always been clean, mostly newer models, and well-maintained. For the most part, the drivers get you in a short period time. However occasionally you might get a driver that suddenly realizes he doesn't want to take the call and you suddenly see on the map that he's going in a different direction. That could be frustrating when you're waiting for pick up, luckily, it has rarely happened. Overall, Utaxi is very good.",1
6185,9/26/17,Utaxi is very convenient and always on time within five minutes of stated time and you always knew where they were at and how far away from you they were. I would recommend the service to anyone who needs a lift.,1
6189,9/25/17,"Arrived in LAX 8 hours ahead of schedule due to change of plans so our pickup wasn't available. My daughter suggested to try Utaxi so we did after comparing the fare going home which was about the same. A black shiny Suburban picked us up in less than 10 minutes. The van interior was clean so was the driver. He was pleasant to talk to and he drove us home safely. It was a pleasant experience that from now on, no more dirty taxis and smelly cab drivers for me.",1
6190,9/25/17,"Using Utaxi was a pleasant surprise and I love the fact that they are available on short notice. The prices are much more affordable than the taxi cabs I was using prior to Utaxi and fare payment via credit card is great. They offer and deliver good service which I felt was safe and everything already in the system and no need to pull out anything. I also tried Utaxi as driver for several months... It was fun! I only had one incident that caused me concern after calling Utaxi and confirming a ride. Between 11:00-11:30 pm close to a price surge time, I was switched to several different driver confirmations which caused a 45-minute wait and that night I finally called a cab.",1
6191,9/25/17,"I live in a very small town and at times there is no one available to pick up. Utaxi is great in large metropolitan areas. Drivers are very polite and punctual. I noticed that the ride would state a different amount, however after I am dropped off the price has increased. There is no customer service number. I understand that even the drivers don't have a main number to contact for Utaxi Corporate. That is a serious issue. Every company should have a human to speak with for concerns.",1
6194,9/24/17,I used Utaxi for a couple of medical appointments. The drivers were prompt and so friendly and I could not have been happier. The cars were spotless and I had lots of floor space. The rides were smooth because the cars were very nice and that's important with all my back issues. I highly recommend Utaxi to anyone and everyone!,1
6195,9/24/17,"The service was convenient (just a phone call and they came to our location). The drivers were always on time, courteous, and helpful. Their fee was usually less than the commercial cab fares and the vehicles were all clean and efficient.",1
6197,9/23/17,"I am in a non-profit organization that is financially assisting seniors with no other transportation choices to use Utaxi via 24-Hour Care home health. Our Friends of Outreach will pay the app fees and the charge for rides for vetted seniors through the non-profit via the city of Irvine. Certain seniors who don't have access to a phone that can connect the apps, and also don't meet the criteria for use of other transportation modes we support financially, are using the service on a trial basis on 12-week contracts. So far so good.",1
6200,9/22/17,"I am not sure how to reach out to Utaxi if I have a unique question for example airport pickups or gated community pickups, car seat issues etc., so I will opt out and not use them in those instances.",1
6209,9/20/17,I have used Utaxi many times and I have had good experiences 99% of the time. I like the convenience of the automatic payment and most of the drivers are great as well.,1
6212,9/19/17,"I have used Utaxi in Orlando and NYC. The use of the current technology helps to obtain ground transportation very fast but the exception is during a rainstorm. In NYC, I had challenges obtaining transportation.",1
6219,9/17/17,"I absolutely love Utaxi! They are very convenient, quick and for the most part very safe. I use Utaxi every day and I've only had a few issues which weren't that traumatic. As of this point, I don't know what I would do without Utaxi. I rely on them to go everywhere and in the case of needing to go to an event where it's going to be packed, with parking being horrible, Utaxi is a no-brainer. They drop you off close to the event, you don't have to worry about paying for a high prices parking spot. Overall, I am very happy with Utaxi.",1
6221,9/17/17,PROS: Really easy to use and fast arrival time of the car. CONS: Background check doubtful and sometimes car description is not accurate.,1
6224,9/16/17,We didn't want to drive in San Francisco after parking at our hotel. We used Utaxi 4 times and found the response times fast and the drivers courteous and careful to obey laws. We knew about the higher prices at rush times and were not surprised at the higher but reasonable charge during the one time we rode at 5:30 pm. We will use Utaxi again on our trips to unfamiliar cities.,1
6229,9/15/17,I hear about Utaxi from friends that used it. They all say the same thing about this company and that is the ease of getting the service 24 hours a day and the price which is better than a taxi.,1
6230,9/15/17,"I enjoy the cheap cost, but I feel saddened by the negative impact on the taxi drivers that have far better qualifications to drive people around. So many Utaxi drivers do not know the area in which they drive and are not safe drivers, often not obeying basic driving rules.",1
6231,9/15/17,"I was in L.A. and a friend had the Utaxi account and software on her phone so she put-in the requests. I used Utaxi twice (maybe three times) in L.A... They were fairly short rides that went very, very well. The drivers were very friendly and the cars they were driving were newish and clean.",1
6235,9/14/17,Used their service for a week of vacation in downtown Chicago. Drivers were always available and service was quite prompt. The drivers and vehicles were clean and they were concerned for our safety by good driving practices. Even the pickup and drop off from the USA women's soccer game in Soldiers field was accomplished to our satisfaction even though the area was crowded with spectators. The prices were very reasonable. Very satisfied with the service.,1
6237,9/14/17,"I like the Utaxi app which lets me know where their cars are in proximity to my location, who my driver is, what car they are driving and when they will arrive to pick me up. I love that I do not have to tip. I get in the car and the driver already knows where I want to go. I get out as soon as we arrive and immediately get an opportunity to rate the driver. The service is great.",1
6240,9/13/17,"I had to use Utaxi for a few occasions when my car needed repair. I used the app which is really convenient to use. It shows you what cars are in your local area, how close they are to your location. They show you who the driver is, and approximately how soon they can arrive. I found that my drivers were polite, good drivers. I will use them again as needed.",1
6241,9/13/17,"Utaxi is great for transportation for medical appointments. The call center has always been prompt and courteous with me. The drivers I've had in the past have been very caring and loyal to their customers. They were pleasant, caring, compassionate, and humorous as well. The only thing that has ever bothered me is the extensive wait time for pickup from my appointments. Utaxi puts more on their drivers than should be in my opinion. I have personally seen the stress and anxiety in the drivers.",1
6243,09/12/2017,It's an economic and convenient service. I like the convenience of the app and being able to track just where my driver is. I've never had any situations that I felt were unsafe or threatening.,1
6244,09/12/2017,I started using Utaxi while on vacation in Arizona a couple years ago. Took it to and from the airport. I was shocked on how easy it was! I LOVE that there is no money that exchanges hands at all. I was a little leery about providing my credit card info when I signed up but I've never had a problem. I've used Utaxi so many times since then in different places... Like Chicago! It's just so much cheaper than a cab plus the drivers are usually very friendly and like to tell you about different places to visit (if you're a tourist). Recently I was on a trip to San Francisco and used Utaxi the whole time. Something new I learned about while there was Utaxi POOL. The driver picks up a number of people at different stops and drops everyone off at their pre-determined destination and it was only $4.99 per trip because you are sharing a ride with others. Very cool!,1
6247,09/11/2017,"Utaxi is great as long as you are traveling by yourself or with someone over age 4. If you're a single mom with a baby there are ZERO cars that offer baby seats. You are expected to lug a seat with you which is horrible if you are trying to go out shopping or something. You can't exactly lug around a giant car seat. Single moms need an option too. There also aren't many women drivers, I have only seen one.",1
6248,09/10/2017,"Rates are very reasonable. Pickup times are pretty prompt. However, sometimes they come early then charge for wait time and a few times I had to wait on them. Cars are usually very clean and comfortable. Drivers are not always chatty so it depends on preference if you like to talk or not, BUT they are concentrating on GPS etc. One driver I had didn't stop for stop signs and he must have thought the signs said ROLL.",1
6251,09/09/2017,Same of your drivers have different things in their car. All drivers should care some extra things but I have always been happy with the service.,1
6255,09/08/2017,"I suddenly became very ill at work. I usually take the bus home, but was too ill to do that. I got on my phone and saw that many Utaxi vehicles were already circling my block at work, so a vehicle arrived promptly, before I could even come down on the elevator. The driver was a woman who was a previous healthcare worker, and she assured me that I could relax, and not to worry. If I got sick she could take care of me. Talk about customer service! She was so kind, I immediately felt better.",1
6259,09/07/2017,"The first time I used Utaxi was in SF. Several times they were fantastic, then NYC that was not as great but still very good. Just took longer in NYC and not as friendly.",1
6266,09/04/2017,"I have used Utaxi all over the world and it has always been prompt and convenient, as well as cheaper than a standard taxi. The drivers have always been polite and some have also been more friendly. I do have reservations about many aspects of the so-called gig economy and feel a little guilty when I use services such as Utaxi, but I cannot fault the service I have received as a customer.",1
6267,09/03/2017,At first there was an issue with my charges... I was in the wrong and very nasty with Utaxi's cust service. Because I felt I was being ripped off. I said I will sleep on it and voila... first thing in the morning not only was the correct amount adjusted to my bank but it was less than what I thought. Way to go Utaxi. I stand corrected and I will not only recommend your service to my friends and colleagues but I will use your services AGAIN when I need a rideâ€¦ Plus you taught patience to an old pushy dog. Lol great job and will be contacting you guys soon!!! Thank you.,1
6268,09/03/2017,"I've taken Utaxi only half a dozen times, and all but one were pleasant experiences. The unpleasant experience went beyond the pale however. I probably could have contacted Utaxi during the ride and I'm sure arrangements would have been made to care for the problem, as their customer service has always been stellar. All told, Utaxi has been a lifesaver on those occasions I didn't want to drive.",1
6270,09/02/2017,It was my first time using the service and I found it to be quite convenient. The app was easy to use. I was able to download it and then order the car quickly. The car arrived when they said it would and being able to track the location of the car before it arrived was cool. Paying in advance was also convenient since it meant you knew the cost of the ride beforehand and the price didn't change for slow traffic or anything else.,1
6271,09/02/2017,"For the most part, Utaxi is convenient and fast. Need a way to tip. 1 driver with road rage, but very much the exception. Still way better vetting than taxis.",1
6273,09/01/2017,Used Utaxi while in Boston MA. Driver was excellent and knew his way around during peak driving time after work. We used Utaxi 3 times and always got to our destination on time.,1
6274,09/01/2017,"I have used Utaxi many times, and each time I have been exceedingly pleased. The drivers were prompt, courteous, and professional. I highly recommend Utaxi.",1
6275,8/31/17,"Great for the rider, they get quick service. Poor pay for the drivers due to a flooded market. No concern given to the fact that if you hire too many drivers there will not be enough riders to make the trips worth your time and fuel.",1
6283,8/26/17,"I just wanted to write and let all of you at Utaxi that I had the most amazing driver the other day! As soon as I got in the car, he handed me a bowl of delicious treats, I thought that was so sweet! Then he handed me a bottle of water. This may not be a big deal to some, however, it actually made my day! He was so polite, helpful, generous and all around awesome!!! Please please let this driver, Jasur Nazarou # 5756433 know that he is awesome!! He deserves some sort of praise from all of you at Utaxi! All of your drivers should take notes from this guy! All of your drivers need to be like him!!! WONDEEFUL EXPERIENCE!!!!Stephanie Angelini @Angelinistephanie. *****@yahoo.com.",1
6285,8/25/17,"I recently started driving for Utaxi and you know what everything has been exactly as it was supposed to be. Will there be a hiccup at some point? Probably. But all of you who are saying you got ripped off so many times, first of all I don't believe it has happened as often and as badly as you all claim but if it has happened to you more than 2 times then maybe instead of bit@#$ing about it you should just stop using it. I drive because I need the extra money and most of the problems you may or may not have are caused by the app or the company not the drivers. I am very professional and have not had one issue with a rider or the app as of yet and I depend on the money to support my family so I take it very seriously. Please at the very least don't give drivers bad ratings because your fare was too high or the wait was too long. we get there as fast as we can at least the good drivers. Bad reviews for the drivers when it is the app or the companies rates fault can cause us to be deactivated. I like the extra money I earn and depend on it to do fun things with my family. Rant over.",1
6351,01/11/2014,"I have used it several times-maybe 6-7 and I found it to be easy and painless. I like the idea that I know what I am paying before they arrive, thus its my choice to use or not. No messin around with driving all over the place. I have seen coupons and promo codes too that take off 10-20% quite frequently. anyway, there ya go!",1
6356,05/08/2013,"Utaxi is kind of like magic. You punch a few buttons on the app on your phone, and you watch as a black car appears out of nowhere at your doorstep. It's so much better than calling a taxi it's ridiculous. It does come at a price though--the black car service I've found to be about 20-25% more than a taxi, and the Utaxi taxi service was maybe 10-15% more. But honestly, it's kind of worth it. It's so painless...if only every service was like this.",1
408,15/03/2023 04:36,Driver is super,1

5717,7/25/18,"The service is great! I trust my children riding with Utaxi. And the benefit to the community is not measurable, I'm confident the service has saved many accidents and damages to persons and property.",1
5725,7/24/18,"The vehicles were all clean over our recent trip to Washington DC. The drivers were all kind and friendly... Overall, it was a much nicer experience than the cab rides.",1
5729,7/24/18,"Utaxi is not only an excellent service, it has been for me one of the most important service I can't live without it, practical and all my experiences up to today very good, with very kind and respectful drivers.",1
5750,7/21/18,"Convenience, on-time performance, easy to hail a ride, competitive pricing with a regular taxicab. Helpful drivers too. App also makes it super easy to find a ride in minutes.",1
5751,7/21/18,"I buy gift cards for my son and he uses them quite often. I have had problems a couple times, but it is usually on my end. But when I call for help, they are great. They handle it very quickly. He has only had problems with a couple drivers, but other than that both of us are very happy with the service.",1
5758,7/20/18,"They found me just fine. Only had one time where they couldn't find me, but someone else found me. And I got home just fine. And he waited until I got inside. He made me feel very comfortable.",1
5771,7/18/18,A very convenient service. The cab industry got out-maneuvered. They could have/should have started the same type of service using their cabbies. Utaxi is also relatively inexpensive to use.,1
5774,7/17/18,I have had four very good Utaxi rides. The website is easy to use and a driver usually shows up pretty quickly. I had to wait once because there was no available drivers but the wait wasn't long. So far so good.,1
5776,7/17/18,"The service was great, the driver was appropriately friendly, cost was good too. The car was clean as well. I appreciated the service. I have recommended the service and would use again myself.",1
5778,7/17/18,Am so grateful to have Utaxi. But wish they had a phone number. The drivers have been great. Cars have been clean and comfortable. I don't drive and will use Utaxi fairly often.,1
5781,7/16/18,I have had very successfully rides with Utaxi. Very dependable and safe drivers. Downloaded app is very easy to use. Responsibly priced and would definitely use them again.,1
5782,7/16/18,"For the most part I find the drivers to be friendly, professional and careful. Also, they arrive promptly. However, occasionally a driver speaks about political views which is inappropriate conversation. I experienced this in London but the local drivers haven't discussed touchy topics.",1
5784,7/15/18,"The driver was very knowledgeable about the area, great conversation. The car was clean and had a nice scent. He was on time, opened the door and even offered mints.",1
5801,7/13/18,Fast and low cost service. Used five times so far and always reliable. Sure beats taxis. Drivers were very professional and easy to work with. Paying for the ride with my credit card and the map showing where my driver is relative to picking me up are nice features.,1
5807,07/12/2018,I needed a medical transportation vehicle. They were the cheapest by far and they were trained professionals. The cost was approximately 10% of what transport services was charging.,1
5815,07/11/2018,"The driver I had was professional, friendly, and personable. He made sure we were safe in his car, got to our destination safely. I would definitely use this car service again.",1
5816,07/11/2018,"Our drivers, two different ones, were very polite, helpful and interesting. Now I love Utaxi! We had quite a bit of luggage and three people. Loaded everything in comfortably.",1
5822,07/10/2018,"I had no problem with my Utaxi experience except the car was very strong smoke smell. Must of been in seats because my clothes smelled like stale cigarette smoke. It was a very nice car, clean, driver was a very polite/courtesy young man. I use Utaxi and will continue. Everyone has been great.",1
6147,10/07/2017,"I've had limited but really optimal experiences. I only use the service occasionally like three times in the last two years, but nice cars, good people, short wait, very low prices.",1
6150,10/06/2017,Love Utaxi. First time user but was very impressed of the reasonable price and efficient service. The driver was very nice and helpful too. I would have given a five star but we had to go to a certain station to catch our ride not at the curbside by the baggage claim area.,1
6154,10/05/2017,My car was in the repair shop and I needed a ride home from work. I used my Utaxi app and my driver was there within 15 minutes and she was very professional. Her name was Joke and I said I would use her services again. Great experience!,1
6158,10/04/2017,"We had occasion to use Utaxi for the first time in Washington. D.C. last fall. The service was convenient, dependable, economical and very easy to use. The service was friendly and on time, the drivers courteous. A very good experience.",1
6176,9/28/17,"This was very convenient and inexpensive. I used it with some friends to make a trip out on the town to celebrate a birthday. It was awesome, fast service both going and returning.",1
6179,9/27/17,"We used Utaxi for the first time to attend a wedding reception in Portland and we loved it. The ease of using it was awesome. The people that picked us up were professional, clean and friendly.",1
6196,9/23/17,It's a really great thing. They should have more incentives for discount rides after you build up lots of rides or give them references for business. But other than that they are very safe and a great concept.,1
6206,9/21/17,"They were always prompt, knowledgeable, courteous and professional. They are ideal for when you are out of town and I plan to use them often.",1
6213,9/19/17,"My first experience with Utaxi was taken from Seattle Airport. The vehicle was really clean and the driver was very courteous, safe driver and professional.",1
6216,9/18/17,"Originally a wonderful, less expensive and convenient alternative to cabs but it has become more awkward and expensive as popularity has grown.",1
6220,9/17/17,I've always found Utaxi reliable and professional nationwide. They are my go-to choice for transportation when I travel for business or pleasure.,1
6222,9/16/17,"My driver was personable, and made me feel safe. It was good to come across a patriot rather than the grunts and groans one usually encounters with car service drivers.",1
6223,9/16/17,"The driver we had was very professional and polite and he was easy to talk to and understand. He was also nicely dressed along with being very helpful with other points of interest that we might like. Plus, he took good care of his vehicle and kept it very clean. Because of him we will be glad to try Utaxi again if needed.",1
6228,9/15/17,"I used Utaxi for the first time in the Washington, DC area several months ago. My son who lives there showed me how to use the app; within just a few minutes, our ride arrived and we were safely back at our location. Waiting for public transit would have been over an hour transport time. The driver was very professional and nice.",1
6236,9/14/17,"I used Utaxi services when I was going to a family get together. The driver was on time, polite and had good everyday conversation with me and the children.",1
6242,9/13/17,"Not a real frequent user, but every experience the same. Close by, on time, good drivers, nice conversation if we initiate, safe to destination, no problem at the end of the ride.",1
6260,09/06/2017,"Utaxi is great because I have used it in India, Singapore and got great rates in the US too. They have special deals and I wish they had more of those because it makes it so much competitive with the mass transit.",1
6290,8/19/17,She continually amazed me with her skill and expertise on the road. She was very kind and courteous and knew every possible avenue of travel. Props to Utaxi for their fine selection.,1

243,09/03/2023 06:20,He arrived on time and I reached to the destination so fast,1
425,15/03/2023 19:29,"The driver was delayed due to previous trip (not his fault), but made his best to get us to the airport in time",1

5916,05/01/2018,"We used Utaxi for the first time in Panama City Beach last weekend. All three drivers were wonderful. We had a blast. The first driver was so sweet and smart, his daughter called him while we were driving and he would not even talk to her because he was on the job, second guy was sweet and country and professional, third was a female, very sweet and took us right to our motel. We will be using them on our next trip. I don't get the bad reviews but I was in Florida so people may be nicer there. Thank you Utaxi.",1

6031,1/16/18,"I lost my phone in the Utaxi last night. Attached to the phone was my credit card with a large limit on it. We panicked and cancelled the card. The next morning we called the Utaxi hotline and they had the driver call us. The driver searched the car and found the phone and the credit card. He drove 30 miles to return it to us. His name was Felipe and he drives in Ft. Myers Beach, FL. We were so impressed with his efforts to find the phone and to return it to us. He even questioned us to be sure we were the folks who ordered the Utaxi so he didn't give the phone to the wrong people. So wonderful to know that there are honest people out there who still care!! Thanks Utaxi Driver, Felipe.",1

6257,09/07/2017,"I started using Utaxi about four months ago. My first two rides went perfectly. I was able to state where I was located, as well as the two locations that I wanted to go to. However, the third time that I wanted to use Utaxi, I was no longer able to put in two locations, just one. I didn't realize that at that point, and only realized it once a driver was driving me to my primary location. My driver was amazing enough to drive me to my second location; as thanks for this, I paid him with the few dollars that I had in my wallet.",1

Their verification to do anything is totally ridiculous. I've spent over 30 mins playing I'm not a robot over and over till I've so mad I given up! All I wanted to do is give a tip!",1
5828,07/08/2018,"Had my first ride with Utaxi. I was excited to get 15 dollars off my first ride. You see I have been taking Be-taxi back and forth most work days and since I am a well known rider my promos are somewhat limited. I spend enough for a car payment every 2 weeks and well I've never had a bad experience and even though most of my funds are used for this type of transportation, not once have I felt insecure or worried that I would be late or even have a thought of not making it at all. Today was a totally different experience. I ordered my ride on the Utaxi app and even though it's a little different I had no trouble figuring out how to add my 2 stops. I was charged and told my driver would arrive in 8 mins so my daughter, husband, and I waited at the front of my apartments at the office like we always do.",1

5840,6/26/18,"They did it twice. They overcharge. Last month some driver charged me 390 when it was showing 298. He said in mine it showing this, when asked to show he said you check it again. But since my sister had booked it and I did not have the phone agreed and paid. I did not all her for somepersonal reason. But last night I was a fool I did not call my sister to confirm. The driver named swapnil picked me up from matunga at 9.45 and dropped me at powai. His car was from panvel. He was going to go without a passenger once I get down. The bill shown was 317 and he charged me 450. I gave him since I was in a hurry, instead I should have called my sister and confirmed. But is this ethically right? If I want to spend much money no matter how small or big the amount is I will do it all my will. I do not want such thugs around. Everytime overcharging.

I get in the car and get about a mile up the road and the Utaxi driver is heading in the direction of the neighboring county, though I'm in the next county in the complete opposite direction. I told him to turn around and go down a road heading in the correct direction to my home, but he blurted out, annoyed stating ""that road is shut down, and I can drop you off here and you can wait on the next Utaxi"".

Whatever then even after waiting for long... It was still that far away... It was no use. Later I had to cancel the ride as it was just not approaching on the map towards me. It was going ahead.

Meaning I can go to Walmart today at 5 p.m. from home and it can cost for example $7 then I can go to the exact same Walmart from home on a different date and that ride will cost $13. Or I'll take a ride from home to Walmart and it cost $7 then when I go to get a ride from Walmart to home the ride will cost $13. No. I don't understand how the prices can fluctuate so much.,-1
5935,4/14/18,I don't understand why Utaxi expect you to pay the driver for a trip when they have taken you to the wrong place. Because the drive GPS pick the wrong locate. I think that a Driver should check the locate where you're going when you live in a Big city when there a lot of places that sound and spell the same. Very dissatisfied. Very dissatisfied. Very dissatisfied.,-1

She had water bottles on the floor and crumbs on her seats. I couldn't even dust them off because of the kind of seats she had. So I sat in crumbs the entire ride to work.When it was time to drop me off, she was at the wrong location once again and I had to get out and walk a block to my building.

I didn't hear anything for almost 24 hours and when I did it was a prompted message that did not help at all. It has been almost 2 days and I still have no received a phone call or any helpful support via email. This is a nightmare and the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I am going to be filing a police report to the person who myself and the driver caught fraudulently using my account and looking into an attorney for Utaxi not making identity theft a priority and rectifying the situation on their end.,-1

5638,10/25/19,Utaxi is overcharging for Toll fees. When In Florida the Tolls fees estimates between $ .75 to $ 2.00. Utaxi price shown will be Example $ 16.73 for the ride. After you take the ride you get charge 28.23 and when you check the account it's telling you that you got charge for Tolls. The driver never took the toll route and you try to contact Utaxi company and they take long to get back to you about the issue of being overcharge.

It took days of back and forth with tech support to find out that my card ""isn't compatible with their system"", but they refused to be more specific than that and no matter how many times I asked what the exact problem was (ie my bank, the type of card, etc) all they did was rephrase the same answer over and over again with canned responses; repeatedly telling me to check w/ my bank, even after I told them I already had done so.",-1

5650,10/14/19,Upfront pricing not true pricing. Utaxi pads the bill so much. I've had Utaxi drivers charge for wait time when they are parked down from my house and I am out on my front porch waiting and watching them. Booking fee $3.05 come on! Toll and surcharges plus time and distance charges. Now they are dropping me off a few blocks from my destination saying they got to take another call. Utaxi drivers that I have used have showed up at my house wanting a hookup. One driver started groping me on my front porch. Utaxi customer service is a brick wall. Credited me $3.00 on a ride on Utaxi Cash. No matter what they do or charge they have an excuse and they are right. When I reported the sexual harassment of the two drivers they suspended my account. They cost more than a taxi and a taxi never has told me to get out and walk the rest of the way.,-1
5651,07/03/2019,I was in Montreal last week as it was raining. Wanted a quick ride to my destination so booked an Utaxi. The amount displayed was between 27-35 (which included surge). I didn't mind it as I was running late and wanted to get to the destination on time. Unfortunately there was an event taking place at the location and the cops had blocked some of the roads - due to heavy traffic and roads being blocked it took me 50 mins to get to my destination as opposed to 20 mins and to my surprise at the end of the ride the driver told me there is waiting time added to it which I wasn't aware off as Utaxi doesn't tell you the amount right away. You don't have the visibility as you do in most cabs. You can see the meter and make a quick decision of either taking the ride or stopping it right away.,-1

Then it asks if I want to pay 25 dollars to get to pay 9.99 for the ride instead of the 13-14 dollar price. This has happened 3 times now. I'm sorry but I'm not gonna pay 25 bucks so that I can pay another 10 for the ride home. That's ridiculous.,-1
5673,5/17/19,"My wife and daughter spent a couple of days in Belfast. They decided to use Utaxi on the 1st day. Hotel Etap to Primark, journey is roughly 1 mile and had the cheek to charge them Â£14. This is someone taking advantage of 2 women on a break. It took them 10 minutes to walk back to the hotel. Didn't even want to leave the 1 star but you can't give them zero. This behaviour is disgusting.",-1
5675,5/17/19,"I used to be so happy with Utaxi until I got a ** driver who decided to scam me by taking a massive detour for some extra bucks even though he was aware at what time my flight was leaving. I was in the car with my baby girl in the car seat trapped on this traffic jammed highway asking him to please stay on route because I needed to catch my plane. Him giving me one ** story after another and keeps driving . By massive detour I mean a ride that usually even with heavy traffic takes an hour max. With his scheme it took me 2,5 hours.",-1
5676,5/17/19,"All the cabs provided by Utaxi in India are extremely dirty and have a horrible stench settled in them which mostly comes from the drivers. The mats are literally matted with cakes of dirt and the seat covers are almost always stained. To top it all the drivers are really unprofessional, they refuse to come up on the pickup point and if they don't feel like executing the ride, the driver ends up calling the rider and asks them to cancel the ride. Hence lowering the rating of the rider. I have had extremely bad experience with Utaxi at multiple times. I have been dropped in the middle of the road by the drivers just because they didn't have an internet connection to check the maps. The drivers are racist as well sexist and on many an occasion have passed very rude and vulgar remarks.",-1
5677,5/17/19,It's absolutely horrible experience and felt systematic loot by the corporate whose tariff not controlled by any government authorities. Neither they care for our laws. The charge for Goregaon west to CST RAILWAYS WAS Approx 1000/- INR WHEN I GOT DOWN within 2 km they charged me 230/- as penalty. Is our government protecting our right and controlling unethical business practices of Utaxi? Disgusting.,-1
5678,5/16/19,I have been charged several time for wait time fees. These are fraudulent charges. The 2 charges Utaxi refunded and now I have another one and they will not refund. How do we get to stop charging fraudulently for a service not received?,-1
5679,5/16/19,After continuously reminding that i was charged more by the driver i have not yet got refund nor yet any customer executive is assigned to this matter. It's been four days. I have not received any mail regarding it. It's really difficult to contact Utaxi as there is no direct call center for customers complaints. We just have to write on Utaxi help or support but dont get any response from them. I know writing here also will not sort my issue but it's just ridiculous.,-1

I've explained 3 times that is not the place I entered and asked when he would be at my address 5 miles away. The driver cancelled my order and refused a refund. I contacted Door Dash for the same restaurant and they saved the day. DO NOT USE Utaxi EATS!",-1

Now, after nearly 2 hours of trying to access my account data, it won't accept my password. After over an hour of trying to reset my password and receiving numerous reset codes from Utaxi, they still won't allow me access the account!

Sneaky way of personal data collection & robbery at the same time.",-1

Using my locator app I saw he went across the bridge back to NJ so it adds more proof. Then he lies to Utaxi rep, saying he didn't have my bag yet when I threatened to go to the police he lies again saying he dropped it at 3 separate locations. So, if he didn't have it as he told Utaxi, why claim you dropped of a bag you never had... LIES!",-1

As we are in the process of closing on a house, making sure our accounts are straight is critical... Yet there are the Utaxi charges soaking up funds without ever going into a status to dispute them. Utaxi rather unhelpful â€˜help' page says these charges are necessary to verify account. Normally, these charges are pennies... Not the same amount as a ride (for each of several â€˜verifications')?",-1

I noticed that I had requested a ride to Newark airport for a colleague and they billed me the ride to Flushing, NY instead and doubled the price. I disputed the charge with my credit card company but paid them $38.00 for the ride. After that I tried to get them resolved but it is so difficult since they are clueless and have no intention to resolve the issue.

The driver said the trip was 14 miles. I said to follow my normal 7 mile route, which he did and arrived 10 minutes later. I asked Utaxi to review the charges and refund the obvious erroneous overcharge. They said the fees are final because they are within the estimate. I asked them to explain why the estimate was over 50% higher than the same trip from three days ago.

For whatever reason, the money did not go to my bank. I was told that the amount would be deposited into my account during the following weekly deposit. It wasn't. I am sick of calling your customer service representatives, that apparently have no clue of what they are doing and do not have access to real information.

I called Utaxi from O'hare airport to my home, and this time, I screenshot the upfront price because at this point, I can't trust the company due to my previous experience. Sure enough, while I was already in Utaxi, my upfront price changed from $28.20 to $52.22.",-1

If you can avoid ever using these two companies that would be the best option for you. Go bank and Utaxi support are filled with people who do not know what they are doing.

As a result I lost a large contract, as well as them trying to continually take payments from my account until my bank stopped all payments.

Trust your local taxi firms instead to turn up and not rip you off.",-1
5703,2/20/19,I drive for Utaxi/Utaxi Eats. Whenever a situation occurs and support is needed the headache begins. They are completely scripted responses. They do not actually respond to the situation but instead say it will be looked into. They then email days later and again give a script response. Never actually addressing the questions or issues. Very difficult for both customer and drivers. With customer service being what it is I would suggest avoiding Utaxi.,-1

We took Utaxi to get home, we were little tipsy at that time. I was sitting in front of the car and after five minutes I told to driver that he needs to pull over because I was going to throw up. He eventually pull over the car and I clearly puked outside, the flow of our travel was smooth, the driver was fine. However, the fare was also fine when we got home. Few days later, Utaxi sent me an email that the driver charged me $80 for vomiting inside his car. I called Utaxi service to complain but they did not solve my problem. Ever since that happened, I became more careful using this application. Furthermore, I do not have any bad intentions for the Utaxi company.

5709,2/17/19,"Speaking as a driver for almost two years, as well as a customer for even longer. Utaxi by far has the worst customer service experiences. That is as a driver and customer. Avoid Utaxi at all costs, if you have an issue or report of a wrongful charge on your account, forget about it, you will never see that money again. Utaxi customer support does not even have a number you can call! Finding the email support line is very difficult, and once you do, you won't get a response back or even the slightest bit helpful of a response.",-1
5710,2/17/19,Worst support provided by the Utaxi. They don't have a customer care number and not responding on mail as well. Whenever they want they block the account without informing to customer. Also on mail they didn't provide any reason why they block account every time.,-1

I will NEVER use Utaxi every again. I would NEVER recommend it to anyone. From here on out I will be riding with Be-Taxi. Thanks for the awful experience!

After request, the phone rings and it is the requested driver informing us that because of the weather (winter in Michigan) it would cost us a surcharge of $20 because he had to switch from his car to his truck. I do not see how his switching vehicles becomes our financial burden. Utaxi needs to set limits on things and not allow their drivers to charge customers what they want. They already started charging more in general, now service charges before you even get a Utaxi. Sucks, this used to be a good service.",-1
5721,7/25/18,"I have used Utaxi since they came to my area. The prices have skyrocketed since they first began service here. The last two times I used it, the driver was lost and driving around forever so the wait was extremely long. Besides the price hikes, I really like Utaxi.",-1
5723,7/24/18,Utaxi has really been difficult. I would like to use my account to order food but the number associated with my account is almost 5 years old. I haven't had that number in AT LEAST 3 years but they will not allow me to change it because according to support the only way to change it is through the app. So I download the app and enter my number but obviously that doesn't work cause it's not associated with my email.

5736,7/23/18,The drivers were fine. The problem was I could not speak to a live person. It was very frustrating not to be able to talk to a person. On occasion it took me over 2 hrs to book a ride. Their system went haywire.,-1
5740,7/22/18,"DON'T EVER USE Utaxi!!!! They don't hold any of their drivers accountable for their actions and they are dismissive and unprofessional when you try to contact them to resolve an issue or complaint! I had an Utaxi driver damage my BMW in a hit and run and Utaxi did NOTHING to resolve the issue. They couldn't even apologize on her behalf! I had a description of the driver, her SUV, video footage from the hotel, witness statements, pictures of her car before she fled and they still can't compensate me in any way, let alone apologize! I mentioned that I had to seek medical attention and they don't show any sympathy or concern for my well-being! If this driver didn't have something to hide (i.e. drunk, drugs, weapons in the car etc) then why would she run knowing there were cameras at the hotel and multiple staff who saw her and told she was wrong and she saw me taking a pic of her SUV!? What's even more ridiculous is they don't consider their drivers as their ""employees""! Read this for yourself ""Driver-partners are considered as independent contractors and not employees. This technically means that driver partners are not employed by Utaxi Technologies, Inc or one of its respective company subsidiaries.Also, please be advised that the Incident response team is the sole entity in charge of handling all accidents and property damage claims. All claims that we handle are processed based on facts, reason, and logic.This being said, some customers that are emotionally invested in the situation can take this as a lack of empathy. Their need to be heard and understood will often outweigh their ability to focus on the details of the problem.Lastly, if you would want to directly speak to our CEO you need to find a different channel to do so as we are unable to cater to your request. I trust I've been able to explain our position clearly.""Ps.

I was quoted $35. 20 min later when I got down to the lobby and ordered my Utaxi, the price jumped to $58! I switched to Be-taxi which was only minimally cheaper. Next time I will leave myself more time and take the train! Very disappointed because I really enjoyed taking Utaxi from the airport. Never again! Taxis are cheaper!",-1

There was an option to ""Skip this Step"" so I did. I never got a screen telling me my total or asking me if I agreed to book it or not. Just that the car was on its way. The car that arrived was a huge SUV that could probably seat at least 8 people (I was alone and had one small piece of luggage and a backpack), and when I looked at the receipt later, I saw that they charged me $150 for this unnecessarily huge vehicle. When I wrote them about it they claimed I submitted a different destination location, which is entirely untrue. And they were so cold as to not even give me a break as a 1st time user, refunding at least some of that outrageous total. Terrible company in my experience.",-1
5747,7/21/18,The Utaxi app has the help option but only accommodates a number of preset problem configurations and absolutely nothing outside of it. I had an issue where I was grossly overcharged for a ride.

There is no way to get help or even talk to someone from the company and the app was difficult to navigate. There were added fees like Utaxi technology fee that were not explained or mentioned that was just taken out of our account. There wasn't even a way to ask about it and the drivers got none of the extra money!! Lastly, I kept getting strange texts for Utaxi codes after I began the process of trying to be a driver. I changed my mind when I found out someone was already trying to hack my account and rack up an unknown amount of charges on it. I will not use Utaxi again unless it is like the last time I had to do it an emergency with no other options.",-1
5754,7/20/18,I requested a ride from Times Square to the Statue of Liberty. The rate was $26 and supposed to take 20 mins. There was a lot of traffic so I didn't think much of the long ride until I started to notice all the cars had New Jersey plates. We were in Hoboken because our driver had obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere. To make matters worse he spoke little English so he could not explain what was going on. At one point he turned onto an entrance ramp in error and tried backing up it. When that didn't work he turned around and drove the wrong way. When we finally got to the New Jersey side of the ferry I received the final fare from Utaxi at $77! When I filed a complaint they said I had input the wrong address so it's my fault we ended up in New Jersey and refused to refund me the fare. Numerous emails back and forth got me nowhere so I am left having to dispute the charge with my credit card. Stay away from this scam artist company.,-1
5759,7/20/18,"They play around with the prices a lot, both Utaxi and Be-taxi. You're using a App and it's not really a â€œcompanyâ€œ. That's customer based oriented and you can just pick up the phone and deal with someone. You're a number and it's not personal. The drivers bare all the cost, they pay for the car, the maintenance, the gas, their time and they are not a employee with benefits. Utaxi maintains the app but they charge the customer too much and keep too much from the driver. It's up to 40-50% in Utaxi fees and cost for doing nothing.",-1

The process goes likes this, it asks you to select the pictures with the keyword that was given in the heading like 'Cars', 'Streets' from the list of pictures. I was doing it for some time, but Oh my god, it was so frustrating that it never ends, it will ask for some more than 50 times and it really tests your nerves.

As an Utaxi-veteran, I have experienced the good, the bad and the ugly. Yesterday, I forgot my phone in an Utaxi vehicle. When I realized this, I used my room mate's phone to try to log into my account and contact the driver. However, I had forgotten my password. I decided to request a new one. That is where the trouble started. To help you retrieve your password, Utaxi has a two-step verification; they send you a four-digit code to your phone. This, of course, is for our safety. The problem is ""how do you get the code if you don't have your phone?"" The answer is easy. ""Customer service."" Right? Only mine was not so easy.",-1

I asked if he was an Utaxi driver and he said yes. I asked him to take us to the cruise ship terminal which was approx. 2 miles away. When we arrived he said that it would be $60.00 Yes $60.00. We were very disappointed because he did not give us a price to our destination. When the cruise was over we ended up taking a TAXI back to Penn center which we were charged $10.00. This was a bad experience for us and NYC should have better control of Utaxi drivers. I thought they were supposed to be in line with the Taxis. Utaxi just got their first and last trip from us.,-1

On our drive home he stopped to let her puke. However she did puke on the outside and made a small mess in the car. After our trip I cleaned up everything inside it car as quick as I could. Then a week later we were charged with $150 for cleaning along with the charge of the trip for a very very minimal amount of puke on the seat belt and the outside of the car. We gladly would have paid 50 dollars for clean up however no matter what way we spun it definitely didnt cost 150 dollars to clean a car.

5876,5/31/18,"I have used Utaxi often to get to airport. I used it today to get home, and noticed price they quoted was high. Double. I booked it 'cause after checking all Utaxi options. I asked driver why so high and he said should be normal and that's all he was getting from Utaxi. Emailed them numerous times and didn't give me a reason why they estimated so high and refused to change charge. I keep email them and have stopped responding to me. I will keep going.",-1
5877,5/30/18,"My first time ordering was GREAT! Ordered from McDonald's. With normal traffic it takes 7-9 mins from my place. First time food was mediocre warm but I do expected that. Driver was great, friendly and for price I thought, ""Yep. I'll be using this, though I wish they had more food choices for our area."" Placed order on 3/22 at 2:46 pm. Food delivered 3:20 and as I said mediocre warm (as I expected so no biggy). My latest order on 5/28/18 I placed order same restaurant at 9:01 pm food was delivered at 9:27 pm so 26 mins later versus the 32 mins from 1st order and the food was cold as if it came out of fridge.",-1
5878,5/28/18,I began using Utaxi in February 2018 for travel from home to Philadelphia airport. The price for the first trip was $43.39. I just tried to schedule a pickup for Tuesday morning at 545 am the time I usually travel and the Utaxi X (which I always take) is $82.00. This price has continually gone up over 4 months. Utaxi is no longer a viable option for me.,-1
5880,5/27/18,"I used Utaxi two years ago in Philly multiple times and never had a problem. Had no need to use them again until the third week in May 2018. Logged into the app and scheduled a ride. Everything went well and the driver arrived as expected. I took my ride, tipped the driver in cash (who was very nice and polite) and thought that was the end of it. When I got my emailed receipt, the ride was $10 more than it should have been! I contacted Utaxi through email to resolve and they claimed that I chose the ""Utaxi XL"" trip, which was more $$ (I have to assume because my driver came in a newer Cadillac Escalade?), but I ABSOLUTELY did NOT choose that ride option when I booked it. I remember seeing it as an option, but that's not what I wanted nor chose.",-1
5881,5/27/18,"I had Utaxi drive me about one mile distance to pick up my car from repairs. It wasn't the first time I rode Utaxi but this time I was told to take the rear seat against my protests. C'mon now, I'm just a little old lady. Would do no harm sitting in front. I was unable to fasten my seatbelt as it just won't go it. Meanwhile the car was already moving so I had no choice. I guess the driver didn't care about their passenger's safety. Next time will try Be-taxi. I have no order number on hand as this ride was arranged by the auto repair shop. I don't own a smartphone. The ride took place on May 25 in the afternoon.",-1
5882,5/26/18,"I recently took an Utaxi ride and something seemed very ""off"" about the the driver so I wrote down his name and searched online for him and found his FB page on which he posted numerous videos discussing how he and his girlfriend are homeless and living in their beat up 10+ yr old car ,which is the one he uses to Utaxi,which is sad and indicates that driving for Utaxi is not a great career, but he also discussed  that he takes numerous anti psychotic medications.as well as that there is a protective order against him.! I do not think this person should be driving the public around and Utaxi should do a much better job of choosing who they hire to do so.I would not feel safe using their service again.",-1
5883,5/26/18,"Me and my wife and our son recently visited Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. While we got an Utaxi to a popular night spot approximately 15 min from our hotel. I thought the price was a little high going there, $30.00, but to my amazement, that was just their advertised price, to get back from the same spot, the price jumped to $65.00, more than double for the same distance. That's why we started using Utaxi several years ago to get away from the price gouging cab drivers, but now looks like Utaxi is the ones we need to be leery of. I will not be using Utaxi again. Try Be-taxi, same ride for $20.00. Shame on you Utaxi.",-1
5884,5/22/18,"My daughters Prom was Saturday May 19th, I scheduled a Utaxi Black SUV a week before the Prom to pick up her and her date. At the very last minute we received a message saying there were no SUV's available. We tried for almost an hour to reach someone to get a vehicle. This ruined my daughters Prom, we had to ask a neighbor if they would mind taking them to the Prom. I find this to be so unprofessional. They ended up getting to the Prom about 1 1/2 hour late, missed meeting up with some of their friends to take group pictures. Never once have we received an apology for ruining my daughters special night. I would think twice about scheduling an Utaxi for any occasion.",-1

I thought the prices were really reasonable but the last month or two the prices are going through the roof even for pool. This is terrible when you do this to working people. Looks like I will be taking buses and trains again.,-1
5887,5/21/18,"Got an Utaxi for a 5 mile one way trip. Everything seemed fine, paid fare and gave $15 tip which I thought was generous given the extremely short ride. Received message the next day that driver reported that I left an item in her car and she returned it to me resulting in an additional $15 fee paid directly to driver. I left NOTHING in vehicle and she dropped NOTHING off to me. Googled and apparently these fraudulent fees for lost item returns and cleanings that never happened are common amongst Utaxi drivers to increase their income. Beware.",-1
5888,5/21/18,"While working for Utaxi, Utaxi gives you the option to do InstaPay so you can cash out up to 5 times a day, they boast, they also charge you $0.50 per transaction. I made two transactions on InstaPay the weekend of May 19/20. Although I never received my instapay transactions and was still charged the dollar for the transfers. Utaxi refuses to give my money back, stating that I accepted the fees! The problem with that statement is of course, that I never received what I paid fees for! If they do this to all of their drivers, I don't understand how they could ever have money problems!!! True scam artists & at least one very displeased Utaxi ""partner"". Not to mention that if you drive food for them that they send the driver to restaurants far from you so they make more money??? Very unprofessional Utaxi, Shame On You!",-1

Upon return home, I tried to reach Utaxi to remedy the situation. They take your money and then are virtually unreachable. I GIVE Utaxi ZERO STARS!",-1
5897,5/15/18,"I ordered an Utaxi in Albany NY this morning. I selected Albany Airport as my destination. The driver arrived on time in a car that seemed dingy and small but it was supposed to be a short ride so no problem. Except that it turned out not to be a short ride at all. To reach the airport, he needed to take a right out of the parking lot and then another left at the major intersection. It's knew that it was that simple to find and I had only been in the city 3 days. He took a left out of the parking lot and I questioned him as I knew that was wrong.",-1

He was in front of the house before I could cancel, so I was billed $5.00 for a cancelled ride. The Utaxi company APP is lousy when it comes to scheduling advance rides, furthermore, when the driver arrives before you can cancel, you are still billed for the call. When trying to contact Utaxi directly, you cannot do it. No number exists for the city in which you are scheduling the ride and no number exists for a one to one contact to explain your situation. The only number is a help option but it does not work for complaints, only for emergencies. Not going to use Utaxi in the future.",-1
5899,5/13/18,"Poor service and a rip-off! Yesterday I requested Utaxi ride service at 8:34am. At 8:37am they confirmed the request and advised the car and driver and pick up location, which was a street corner 5 minutes walk from my home, which I thought was odd for not picking me up at my home. My wife and I stood there in the direct sun waiting... then the Utaxi App sent me notice saying it would be another 4 minutes wait... then another notice saying it would be another 5 minutes... then another notice saying it would be 13 minutes... then another notice saying it would be 19 minutes.",-1

I had a pool driver who never came, and as a result, I had to order a different more expensive Utaxi driver (at 3x the price) to get to my location on time, like I would have had the driver come on time or I had taken the train. I contacted customer service (which is a hassle in itself) and asked to be refunded the difference but was told that they â€œappreciated the feedbackâ€",-1
5903,05/08/2018,"26 April, 2018, Maryland, USA. I ordered an Utaxi to Dulles airport. There was no incident during the trip that resulted to a damage or spillage... No vomiting, no eating, no drinking. Beverages. I drank bottled water only. When we were dropped off at the airport, the driver did not complain of any damages neither were they any damage to his car's interior and exterior. He even dusted his entire car in our presence before taking off while we loaded our luggages in the cart. However, 12 days after the trip, Utaxi deducted and extra $80 from my account as cleaning fee. After writing to them and demanding clarity, I was sent a picture of a huge mess on one of the car seats. If my mom or older sister or myself made such a mess, it could not have been hidden. I am so shocked by the picture and its source. A vomit of this nature cannot go unnoticed.",-1
5904,05/08/2018,"Saturday, May 5th late morning, I used Utaxi for a 20 minute drive from my home to a high school where my chorus was performing a concert. I have used Utaxi a number of times in the past with positive results. I carried only a light suit bag with me. No food or drinks. I agreed to the $17 fare and was delivered without any delays. Later in the day, my email showed a double charge...two $17 charges at exactly the same time...an honest error, I thought. The next morning they emailed to notify they were correcting my charge to add an $80 cleaning fee! I am disputing this, but the truth is the driver was creating extra charges. I didn't spill or do anything to his vehicle, nor did he advise me of adding a cleaning fee. He complained endlessly during the trip of his late car payment. I won't use Utaxi again since this is a nearly impossible dispute. They apparently accept the drivers word with no proof.",-1

I will never use Utaxi again - every time I tried to add my home address, it would find it on the map and then when I would try and add it to my favorites, it kept adding a different address with the same street name in Toronto. I live north of Ottawa 4.5 hours away!!!!!!!! but that wasn't clear from their app because on the list of favorites it only shows the street name and not the town. When I first got in the Utaxi car, the guy went WOW , you want a drive from here to Toronto... that's 4.5 hrs. He had to manually enter the address in his system. then when I selected a 15% tip at the end of the trip, it calculated it on a fair for the original 4.5 hour trip. the $62 flashed by and I said wait a minute..It can't be that much?? He should me that the fair was $14 on his system and Utaxi only adds 20% so it will be less than $20. I said are you sure? He said yes. I felt dumb because it was only the second time I had used Utaxi so got out. After he left, I double checked my phone and saw that yes the fair was $20 but a tip of $62 was added even though I chose the 15% tip option. It must have calculated it on the original 4.5 hour fair. Now they will only give me a credit on my Utaxi account and NOT a refund on my card. On top of that his car was old and rattled although he was nice enough. the whole experience was bad.

You can only book a ride using their app. It does not allow you to review your ride before purchasing it. You are booking a ride unaware that you have booked it. A car shows up, you get charged and if you're not there, you get charged a $5.00 cancellation fee. Drivers are supposed to call or text you when they arrive, but some don't. They drive off because you can't find them and you get charged for the ride and another late fee. There are no human beings available to talk to when you have problems. You have to manoeuvre around in their app to send an email to customer service. This company is a money making rip off.

I'm telling it because if you use Utaxi, you might also want to have a Be-taxi account on standby. I went to IKEA in Cincinnati. After shopping, I logged in to get a ride back to my tractor 4 miles away. My payment was denied. What had happened, according to Citibank, Utaxi hit my card 10 times for a zero dollar amount, therefore shutting it down due to fraudulent activity. Finally, as my phone was running out of battery life, and it was getting darker and colder outside, I was able to choose a method they did take. This can happen, and the Citibank rep informed me that Utaxi does this a lot. Be-taxi not so much. If you use Utaxi have alternate transportation set up. If you are sightseeing know how to get back to where you need to go. Utaxi WILL leave you stranded.",-1

I asked him if he can wait and I come by rickshaw and pick my mobile. He agreed. Bus terminal is just 10 mins from my house. I rushed, however, he was not there. Upon calling he mentioned the passenger was getting late and could not wait. I asked him how will he return my phone he asked me to call back. On calling he mentioned that I need to pay 20 rupees per kilometer to come and deliver the phone accepted. Tried calling him the full day. Finally he said shall come in the evening.

On attempt to confirm ride home I had no credits remaining, even after the first ride receipt only showed $6. This left me stranded and having to walk 4 miles home because I had no more payment options. Contacted Utaxi via email when made it home. They gave me some dumb excuse about an authorization hold on an additional $6 to ensure there was enough on payment method to cover trip. Well first of all, this policy relates to debit or credit card use, and secondly, I've ride many times using gift cards and this never happened. Well they continued to reply saying the hold was released and I should contact my bank. HILARIOUS... what bank... idiots, I used YOUR Utaxi gift card.",-1

I explained to them that I had put the right address and was dropped off at right place, but they refused. The driver's name was Yvonne, and the Utaxi support is from someone named KOUSHIK from India (judging from the time posted, it say April 17th, and it's still April 16th in USA). This stupid jerk kept on telling me that I had different drop off than what was requested. I took back the Utaxi from same place, so check it jerk.

Drivers are charging fees for things that haven't happened, like spills, cleaning fees, burnt cigarettes. I don't smoke, but I learned early on always take pictures before and after your trips 'cause drivers will try to get you.

Second, there is no consistency between the website and the app. What can be done in one cannot in the other and vice versa. Third, the app does not always do what it is told. For instance I wanted to pay with a credit card and it defaulted to another account even though I specifically chose the CC. Fourth, the app rates the rider but does not give feedback. How does a rider know what they did that offended the driver so they can correct it? Finally, the web page and the app are cumbersome. It is extremely ironic that a user has to verify.

I asked why it would be that much more at the same time of day with no traffic from when we took Utaxi from airport. No response or offer to refund me the difference. No apologies.

I have been a customer for a long time but no one get any type of perks for using their service almost every day. It's not fair that there aren't any services that can be helpful to a woman who has anxiety of taking public transportation. It's very difficult and I feel they take advantage of consumer.,-1
5954,3/25/18,Low customer support. Does not have professional customer service. Not proactive and well understand the issue but just promptly answer to meet timeline kpi. I have been contacted an issue for a year and it never been resolved. They assign multiple person to reply on an issue and none of them has just read through the previous email and just randomly answer the initial question by procedure. It makes me feel I am talking to a chat bot with low logical script and takes me too much time to explain in details what is going on. They even copy and paste exactly the same message they had sent to me for 4 times.,-1
5955,3/24/18,"Thank you for refunding the cancellation charge. And as I said, my first rides withUtaxi have been a pleasure.
 Now my more serious concern is being in physical danger when a driver cancels my ride home without warning or cause, will not allow me to re-schedule a ride, and leaves me stranded again, at night, far from home, anywhere in Cuyahoga County. Is there a solution for this very real danger?",-1
5956,3/24/18,"Today, right now as I'm writing this, for the second day, I have been waiting for a ride since 1 pm. It is now 6:02. Drivers have literally been driving right past me for hours.

5957,3/24/18,"Last week I ordered an Utaxi but I canceled it before it arrived and took the bus instead. When I got home I received an email from Utaxi saying that they had revised my charge.

They then sent me several photos which showed what appeared to be damage to a seat cushion from a cigarette burn.",-1
5958,3/23/18,I ordered Utaxi in Fla. The driver came promptly. Anyway when I checked my account this driver in Fla. charged me $150.00 for cleaning her car over the above price which was $26.19. Utaxi stated that the driver sent pic that we spilled and messed up her car. Well my husband and I didn't bring any food and no drinks. We had a suitcase and carry on with no liquids. Also the driver stated she had a customer prior to us that made a mess. So if you decide to take Utaxi I would take pictures of the inside/out so you don't get ripped off. I myself will never take Utaxi again.,-1

Rip off... who can afford that?!! Took a yellow cab instead! I have nothing good to say with respect to Utaxi as they are ripping people off and sometimes get away with it... that should not be allowed! What if a senior citizen is trying to get home and they live on their pension. When I complained about this to Utaxi they said because there was limited drivers... so in other words you have to bribe your drivers that work for Utaxi?? They are losing business from me and I will be spreading the word on this matter!!! BE CAREFUL when paying from your credit card on your app on your phone that you don't accidentally assume you are going to be paying what you normally pay because Utaxi will not reimburse you... they will tell you to go and pound sand!",-1

Next day I saw that Utaxi had charged me for 2 trips -- the first was 0.04 miles to go about a half a block at the airport -- for $18!! This charge is totally bogus; I never ordered that trip. Why in the world I have?? At that rate, ($18 for 0.04 miles) a mile-long trip would cost $45,000! Utaxi refused to refund me the $18. Never again will I take Utaxi.

The driver said that it must have been given to someone else and did not have the food place in a sleeve to keep it warm. I ordered eggs, grits, potatoes, and sledgehammer coffee. The food could not be reheated as the texture and taste would be affected so I had no choice but to toss it. I send several complaints to Utaxi who said that they would credit me for the coffee ($6.99 and no credit to account as yet), but I would not be credited for the food. Sledgehammer $6.99, Egg-Straordinary Breakfast $8.99, Signature Chicken Sausage Patties $4.29, Busy Area fee $1.65, Booking Fee $4.99, Tax $1.80. After paying this much for a breakfast for one person, shouldn't the food be eatable? ***GIANT RIP-OFF*** I feel violated as a consumer.",-1

First for one thing I had to go to work this morning and every time a driver accepted my ride, they would cancel on their way to pick me up, that happened 3 times. I didn't want to be late for work. One of the drivers suddenly texted me and said he can't do my ride and the idiot tells me to cancel. I got a charge for canceling. Then another idiot driver that accepted to give me a ride, he stopped driving. ( I saw him on the map) just sitting there a long time, he texted me finally and asked me if I would mind if he changes vehicles? I didn't answer him, so the weirdo canceled my ride. I'm very angry at this point, so I tried Be-taxi (which is much better) and I got a ride from them right away. I made it to work on time.",-1
5973,03/03/2018,Until a week ago I would always prefer and use Utaxi as a choice. It was good service at the affordable price rate. The rate was always below the yellow cab rate. Since a week Utaxi started increasing rate. It is I think based upon the demand and area you are travelling to. It cost now almost 40% more than normal rate. I find this very unethical as it is done w/o informing customer. I feel being cheated and I am so pissed off that I don't want to use Utaxi anymore. The other day I got a ride from Sunnyside to Manhattan with Utaxi at $34 and on my way back I took a yellow cab which cost $20. This is unbelievably ridiculous.,-1

When my Utaxi approached the 1 minute out mark the driver canceled with no notice. I was picked up again and I immediately call the Utaxi driver and was sent to voicemail 3 separate times.

I also stated I attempted to call 3 times to inform him (""Chico"") that I was at front gate. His exact words were, ""Bye Girl"" and he immediately disconnected and canceled trip.

Zero excuse for this! We could have compensated the driver on his arrival. Who the ** drops off children in a random location??? Worst part of this ordeal? Utaxi double charged us 8.57 for this ride and we had to go pick up the children. Utaxi never refunded any of the money, so we're out 17.14 - thank goodness our kids were ok...",-1

Instead, I was accused and told ""no response needed"" at every turn.",-1
6029,1/17/18,I have had multiple experiences with the driver canceling and since it was over 15-20 mins I WAS CHARGED A FEE. Seriously? The driver cancels and I have to pay a fee???? Then when I messaged Utaxi they gave me an Utaxi credit? I don't use Utaxi often enough for a credit. I paid with debit card and wanted a refund on my debit card. It's very irritating. When I contact customer service about it they apologize and do nothing. Worthless! I will stick with Be-taxi.,-1

6035,01/08/2018,Yup. So Utaxi claimed that a 24 hour McDonald's was open. Ordered 30$ worth of food. They said after 30 minutes they couldn't find a driver and canceled my order. I called back and made sure Drivers were available. They said they were. I placed the same order again. $30. Half hour later turned out that McDonald's wasn't 24 hours and they canceled the order again. Found out that McDonald's doesn't open until 5. Ok fine. Waited until 5 and placed a new $30 order. After half an hour again they had no drivers and canceled my order. Waited until 6am when village inn was open. Called to make sure a driver was available. Ordered another $30 in food. Again. A driver was not available. I called again to complain.,-1

Eventually the price went from between 11-19 dollar to 30,40 dollar?! I complained about it at Utaxi but they won't give me the change back. Never am I going to use Utaxi again.

This was around 9:30 p.m. The driver was polite and was there within minutes of us ordering it. No problem. At the end of our night then, around 1:15 a.m. we called again to have them take us home. Now my house is roughly 10 min from the club so however any miles that is, I don't know, but when we ordered the Utaxi from the club the amount came to a little over $47. YES, I said over $47! And that was just to get ME home, without tip, and not even getting my girlfriend home!",-1

I was able to use it up to a certain point. All of a sudden, Utaxi posted a different promotion on my account. This prevented me from using my original promotion (the way it works the last promo added is used first). I complained and after days and days of going back and forth with emails, I was able to use my promo again. Then, suddenly they changed the expiration date of the promotion. Now it expired on 1/2/18 instead of 4/30/18 as originally stated.",-1

We got a call telling us he thought we were out on the road and he is leaving. My card was charged 6$. I have tried several times to contact Utaxi for a refund and no response.

When the guy arrived, not only was his car visibly dirty, old and making loud noises, when we got in it smelled like my grandfather who owned and worked on a farm with pigs, when he use to come home at the end of the day. Yet, we had very little choice but ride â€” unless, as in the past, we refused and get charged $24 anyway. Which brings me to my next issue with Utaxi â€” there have been times we've ordered a car, got downstairs in the time it would take, and the car is gone! We get charged anyway. Unfair and ridiculous.",-1

My son ordered Utaxi, and the time he received his message, he went out but the driver had left by then... and ignored his calls, leaving him in a road that barely has any car passing from there. Then he finally replied and told him that he waited for so long... Seriously!! Isn't there a charge for this time? The surprise is, when I called him to ask him to go back, he refused, and the second surprise is that my son had to pay for the car that was cancelled by Utaxi not by him... Great service.",-1
6045,12/25/17,Gave wrong rating for the driver by mistake and asked customer care for editing the review. Answer was big NO to it. Sometimes people make mistakes and should be given a chance to correct it. My driver given an excellent service and I gave one star by mistake I felt very bad about. I spend too much time with customer service for helping to correct it. They said driver will not see who wrote the review so I needn't worry about it.,-1
6046,12/25/17,"I waited over 20 mins for 3 different Utaxi drivers. I got charged the cancellation fee because my stupid driver cancelled on me as it looked like on the app he was getting lost. He made like 3 u turns on the street before giving up and said I never popped out for my pickup. I'm on a public st by the bus stop. Other people were getting picked up by Utaxi on the same corner I was and they all got their rides faster than me. The reason why Utaxi didn't return my refund is because it past the 30 days which I understand but I didn't get my notification until it was too late and on top of that they said the fee is to compensate the driver for his time spent driving to my location. Are you kidding me? Driver never showed up. He most likely picked up another rider on the way. I was at a crowded baseball event. If we can track the driver on the Utaxi app, Utaxi should be able to track to see if the driver ever arrived to the pickup location. What a joke.",-1

Each time they replied with a scripted email that stated the last promo code added is the first to be applied and they cannot switch the order they are applied. First, their statement was incorrect because the app did not work as they explained and when I stated this they sent the same scripted response to me. This is deceptive practices and their refusal to fix over $5.13 is ridiculous.",-1

I was in Florida boarding a plane to Wis, I received a call from an individual who asked ""where pick up"" in very broken English. I told him i was boarding a plane and did not request, or need a ride. When I landed in Wis, to my dismay I was billed for a Utaxi driver driving from Wis airport to my Daugher's house. I was shocked! I immediately tried to contact Utaxi by phone. Only to find there is no way to contact Utaxi by phone, even in emergencies! I even had airport police assist to no avail. I then went on Utaxi website to file request for refund. After numerous emails and providing supporting info to Utaxi customer support, the refund was denied. Utaxi position was a driver drove from airport to my daughter's house which I had in Utaxi favorites with No Rider! Really scary!! My daughter is concerned after I told her. I also provided a phone # and requested Utaxi to call to no avail. After denial by Utaxi, I did file a formal request with American Express, and provided same info and support as to Utaxi. After reviewing, to my relief, AE placed charge on hold and put a perm stop on any future fraudulent charges being submitted by Utaxi.",-1
6054,12/13/17,"I recently had two incidents that shaped my many reason not to spend any more money with Utaxi. In New York, Utaxi is more popular among the natives than taking a train. Which is great, when dealing with the harsh winter. The issue is the service coming from the Utaxi drivers and Utaxi's customer service. Most recently I took a Utaxi ride to Far Rockaway, NY to Queens, NY which was a $50 dollar Utaxi pool. The car was very cold and in the beginning the Utaxi driver was very quiet. Once we got closer the destination the Utaxi driver began to get confused on what route to take. As I asked to make a right at the next light he turned around while driving and began to yell at me. We were on a parkway in Far Rockaway with cars driving all around us. He began to shout and hits brake twice jerking me from out of the seat. He begins to curse me out and tell me to shut up until we get there or he will make walk.",-1

Evening before I spent 20 minutes setting up my account and unsuccessfully setting my first trip. The next morning it took another frustrating 15 minutes to make the app understand that I wasn't traveling FROM home but TO home. Such an easy and logical event but the idiot app designers at Utaxi can't see that as an option. I finally left home with anticipation of using Utaxi for the first time. At the dealer I waited for 45 minutes for an Utaxi ride that never showed. Took a cab home and on the way got two messages from Utaxi, the first obviously from another customer asking ""are you coming"" and the second telling me there were no Utaxi cars available... this in Denver!

6063,12/09/2017,"Like the drivers and ease of hailing a ride; also app is pretty good as long as everything is going well. HOWEVER, in Nov and Dec of 2017 my account was hacked and fraudulent rides were clocked in in LONDON and PARIS while I was in the USA. First time it was 4 rides; last time it was 9 rides and it all added up quickly. Two of my CC were used in the process, necessitating my CC Company to shut down one of my main credit cards... what a hassle to deal with all that. Customer Service (once you got it) was great as they did reverse charges (so the only folks out of the money I would assume would be the drivers, unless Utaxi picked up the Fraud Tab). But Utaxi did charge me a ''fee'' for reversing charges, so I did not walk away completely un-bruised. I promptly SHUT DOWN my account and will find another Ride-Share service that is more secure.Utaxi has got some issues to work out... their CULTURE as recent news reports allude to but also a BETTER way (faster and easier) to alert corporate about big problems with the app and web site and FRAUD, etc. The system as it is now is elusive and painstakingly complex.4 Stars for the SERVICE & Riders; 1 Star for the Hacking = 2 stars total as my review/ranking.JP",-1

I messaged on Utaxi app, mentioning the address and asking him if he is going to pick me up? Driver cancelled after 5 mins or so!!! i was stranded with no where to go!!! this is ridiculous. Again Utaxi charged me cancellation charges when driver cancelled the ride? This driver has 5* rating!!! When i reached Utaxi customer service asking me to compensate as i have wasted 30 mins bcos of driver, Utaxi says "" Its ur problem and drivers, we can't take any responsibility for driver actions!!"" 
 Why customers are charged cancellation charges when we cancel even after 2 mins, here driver cancelled after 15 mins!!! 
 Utaxi is a ridiculous company which is misusing customer data and leveraging the loop holes!!
 Utaxi should be banned in US and every customer whose personal info is leaked should be paid compensation!! Utaxi tracks every movement and claims its to improve trip experience!!
 My suggestion is first do a proper driver orientation and back verification, which will definitely improve customer experience!!! 
 Notice that if anyone has Be-taxi and Utaxi, Utaxi price is lower, but if ur using Utaxi alone they hike the price.... they do a predatory pricing!!!",-1

I even got a call from a +44 country code, which is the UK, asking where I was and how to deliver my food. To top it off, my card was expired, yet Utaxi still authorized the charges. I canceled my card with Capital One and wrote two separate emails to Utaxi.

I called the driver right away and could not give her ample directions to get to my dad. She drove around for 5 minutes without me being able to give her directions and my dad could not give her directions, and I got slapped with a cancellation fee.

Also I have been noticing that in the last few weeks I have be quoted a rate, charge the rate, then refunded that rate, and charged a higher rate every trip. The saddest part of all is that in Edmonton Utaxi is the safest way to travel outside of the bus. I wouldn't get into a cab in this city ever and now I don't ever want to get into an Utaxi.

6091,11/08/2017,"My appointment time for auto repairs required a drop-off early am for it to be there and available for a mechanic to begin the work. The Utaxi app was easily installed on my mobile device and was followed with the required information being filled onto the blanks. When typing a phone number, it gave an order to check SMS texts for a confirmation code to be used along with the number. No text sent with first try at 7:30 am. More tries, no texts and had to give up. Four hours later the texts with codes were sent at 11:08 am. Two attempts were unsuccessful at emailing Utaxi headquarters in San Francisco that included a few lively suggestions. As follows; I suggest someone there unclog your ride summoning impacted website rectum by swallowing an online laxative, followed by a readily available Fleets enema from a pharmacy.",-1
6093,11/06/2017,"Whether I am using Utaxi for a ride service or Utaxi Eats ordering food the service has been terrible. Out of the 10 times ordering food from Utaxi Eats 9 times food has been forgotten. Every time I have requested a refund for the missing item until recently they told me to refrain from this type of behaviour and told me they would be restricting my account. Not sure why I should be punished for their drivers not checking the food prior to delivery. Recently while traveling I ordered an Utaxi to the place I was staying, I notified the driver it was a tricky place to find and even provided extremely specific instructions. I attempted to contact the driver numerous times but had no response. The driver cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee. I guess moral of the story is this company makes the consumer pay for their employees mistakes. Please refrain from using this service if possible, I know I'll be finding alternatives.",-1
6094,11/04/2017,Utaxi is a big fraud.. They charged me with double money.. My money was cut from pytm also and my driver also asked for the money.. For the same there was no positive response from the Utaxi customer care ...dont try it... It is a big cheater..,-1
6095,11/03/2017,"Why is it so hard for you to understand that if I am trying to retrieve Utaxi cab, with the same email just a different phone number that it is me? If you say it is for security and you don't recognize the phone number, then your security system is **. Because therefore if it was any good, your security system would link my original number to my new number which is under the same account and recognize that it is me. So stop rejecting my new number. What do you think I want everyone calling me on my private or personal number. Do not respond to this until you have fixed your problems. Or IT will only tell ""you people"" TO SHUT THE ** UP. And now I just tried to send this and you would not let me go past too. Why would I put any amount of stars when you serviced me zero amount of stars.",-1
6096,11/02/2017,"I was in South Beach, FL. I was staying at a major hotel and ordered an Utaxi. The driver could not find me which was ridiculous. I was waiting out front of the hotel which was located on the main drag of SOBE. He hung up on me and charged me $5. I disputed the charge so now I have a credit on my account. Utaxi isn't available where I live. The last time I ordered a car in South Beach the driver hardly spoke English and couldn't find TJ MAXX. My advice... don't use Utaxi in Florida.",-1
6097,11/01/2017,I had damage to my vehicle due to a Utaxi driver my upstairs neighbor used. The trim from the rear wheel well was broke off. The driver didn't leave a note. He kept calling my neighbor. Now he will not answer his phone. Can't get a number for Utaxi to locate the driver.,-1
6100,10/31/17,"Last night I returned home from the airport using Utaxi. Shared a ride. The other person paid $36.97 vs my $58.42. First stop was their residence (farther away from the airport than my place). Needless to say, I was not happy when I heard that my fare was 58 percent more. Utaxi says it's ""dynamic pricing"" and will not issue me a partial refund. And... with the company burning through its cash at over $1 billion a year and turmoil in the executive ranks, one would think the company might be more sensitive to such inequalities.",-1
6101,10/31/17,Did you notice that every time you call Utaxi to complain or ask or do anything over the phone that they intentionally talk slow and always doing some checking in the background and usually the phone call last anywhere between 30 minutes to hour and a half. My phone call was 1 hour and 36 minutes. I have the file phone call recorded. This is not the first time I noticed that the payments are not correct but it is the first time I decided to stand up and call them on it.,-1
6102,10/31/17,"I was a pretty loyal Utaxi customer until my last trip. I open the app and the only three options are 1) wheel chair accessible, 2) Utaxi cab and 3) Spanish. 1) I 100% feel for all handicapped and accept that there are options for them. I think it's great. Should it be the first option? No. Should there be a setting on the app that says the car needs to be handicapped accessible? Yes. 2) Why on earth would I call a taxi when I'm particularly calling Utaxi to AVOID taxis????? The cost of Utaxi cab makes absolutely zero point in calling an Utaxi. It's more expensive! 3) Why in the $#*! do we have a Spanish option when we are in an English speaking country? There wasn't an English option when I was in Croatia using Utaxi recently. Nor did I expect it. $#*! Utaxi I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN.",-1
6103,10/30/17,"Do not lose anything in Utaxi otherwise your experience will be a nightmare getting them to recognize you. My friend had the ride set up however at the end of the trip I got dropped off leaving my wallet in the black leather seats, black wallet at night. Anyhow, my friend needed to provide verification about her account, no problem, except around 40 emails and 2 days later they didn't accept the email address from her account she provided at signing nor her phone number that she was calling from that she used for this ride.",-1
6104,10/30/17,My last 2 experiences with Utaxi have made me use taxis which turned out to be preferable to Utaxi. Two weeks ago called for an Utaxi and my driver did not speak or understand English so I immediately got out and was still charged on Tuesday. October 24th I requested an Utaxi to take me to midway airport. When I received notification that my driver had arrived--I called since I was already waiting outside. He informed me that he was in Lombard. And here I was at the place I am always picked up in Chicago. Guess I am on to Be-taxi.,-1
6105,10/30/17,"Our party of 6 consisted of three of my adult daughters and two friends going wedding dress shopping. We needed an SUV to accommodate all of us, and Utaxi showed a driver 20 minutes away in Sanford, Florida. Perfect, we thought as the reservation wasn't for another 40 minutes. We waited, and waited but the map showed the driver staying at the same place originally shown, yet the eta remained the same. We thought that the map must be frozen, so a reset was done, and then it showed that the driver had picked us up and was on route to someplace other than where we were going AND WITHOUT US! To make matters worse, our credit card was charged and we were very late for our appointment. There must be a way for Utaxi to assure that your card is being used for YOUR trip and not for someone else.",-1
6106,10/29/17,"75% of the time I'm extremely satisfied, but here are my pet gripes: 1) No flat rate from airport, as there are with taxis and limos. From JFK we got stuck at the midtown tunnel and my fare (time + distance) was almost twice the flat taxi fare. 2) The driver's profile does not indicate if they have a FasTrak transponder. Coming from LAX to DTLA on two occasions we were stuck in traffic on the I-110 because the driver didn't have FasTrak and so we couldn't use the express lanes. When a driver accepts the request, if the snapshot description (name, make of car, license #, etc) also had ""Can use FasTrak express lanes - Yes/No"" I would know to reject a pickup from a driver if they lack FasTrak. Another solution would be to have an option in my profile's preferences, to only accept drivers who have FasTrak.",-1
6107,10/29/17,I would file a class action suit against Utaxi. I do not use this service and get billed! My card was taken and used. This company is not checking identification to match cards used for service purchases. This company and/or drivers are allowing minors to ride without permission and are using unauthorized debit & credit cards. There is no direct contact number to resolve these issues unless you create an Utaxi account. Has this happened to anyone else?,-1
6108,10/29/17,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Utaxi has STOLE my MONEY and has made 3 unauthorized charges to my credit card. On top of that, they are not even taking responsibility for it and continuously keep marking my issue as resolved even though I have proof such as my bank statements. There is no phone number or place I could go therefore they are taking advantage of that. There are random charges on my credit card that total to over $30 and I did not use my Utaxi app for a few weeks. When I asked them to explain those charges they say they don't know and just ignore me and mark it as resolved.",-1
6109,10/29/17,"I had driven to KCVG to leave a rental car. Having used Utaxi oh let say a half dozen time in my life. I charge up my phone that had gone dead. Now at the Avis rental car return the system informed me to drive over to the terminal. This is after the Avis agent informs me ""Oh yes. Utaxi picks up here."" I follow the instructions Utaxi gave. I take the shuttle to terminal and do not summon ride until at pickup site. Here is the hurtful thing... Now I could be wrong. While I am looking at the drive from Be-taxi I get this call from the Utaxi driver... ""I am outside..."" the way the exchange starts.",-1
6110,10/28/17,"I used many times Utaxi rides in USA. I Visited Delhi India two weeks ago and had selected my card as the payment method but when I reached my destination the driver requested a cash payment. I thought maybe my credit card was not working here so I paid him cash, later I found out my credit card was also charged. When I requested the refund from Utaxi they give me excuses by automated reply like it's my fault I would have not given cash to Driver. What I supposed to do when driver is insisting to pay cash after completion of ride. At that time there was no way so I could confirm from Utaxi office before paying. Utaxi sent automated emails saying wouldn't have a refund option for this exact issue. SO NO MORE Utaxi.",-1
6111,10/28/17,"My last two experiences with Utaxi were not too great. The car that picked me up was old, dirty and nasty with dog hair everywhere and the air conditioner didn't work. It was 90+ degrees out and we had to ride with the windows down. The experience was a ride to the airport and that was frantic. The man had only been in my town for a few weeks and he was confused on how to get to the airport. I don't think Utaxi is checking on who's driving and in what vehicles.",-1
6112,10/28/17,"Utaxi is frud , Utaxi driver charged double amount from me on 20/10/2017. I was traveling from Thane to vikroli. I checked amount was Rs 176. After dropping me he charged Rs. 470. About this problem I discussed through sms but no positive response from customer care. They are not even return my money. Driver create show on the road so I paid money. But customer care people are also frud people. They don't want to resolve the Issue
  My suggestion is don't go With Utaxi. They don't even have contact number. They are cheaper and cheater",-1
6113,10/27/17,"It's unfortunate to know that Utaxi allows its drivers to rate clients. My rating with Utaxi was 4.86 and after a recent trip out of town and used Utaxi my rating dropped to 4.63. I was kind and friendly to the driver. I engaged in the conversation that he started, I also sent him an additional tip post my trip. I will no longer ride with Utaxi and leave a driver who may be unhappy in his or her job or having a bad day or expecting a cash tip to rate me as a client and passenger. I treat all people with kindness and respect and my driver ratings have always been very good to excellent. You have lost a loyal customer.",-1
6114,10/26/17,"DO NOT ACCEPT RIDE WITH Utaxi DRIVER ""EDGAR"" IN SILVER TOYOTA SIENNA VAN!!! Me, my husband, and six year old daughter requested an Utaxi to take us back to the Sanford International Airport Wednesday, October 25th from Disney's Art of Animation Resort. We had a great experience with our trip to the resort the Wednesday prior with Mike who drove a grey Lexus. That fare totaled $40.49 and we tipped him $10. That said, we requested another Utaxi X for our trip returning to the Sanford airport with the same expected $40 fare - this was the fare provided when we accepted ride.",-1
6116,10/25/17,"I purchased a 100.00 dollar Utaxi gift card from CVS. After downloading Utaxi app adding gift card on my android phone, I get an error message payment error. I've been trying to contact Utaxi for over 2 days and getting nothing but automated response from their so called customer service ""help"". After a useless message they have the nerve to send email ""issue resolved"". I'm out of 100.00 dollars. I even went to Facebook attempting to get a resolution same automated response!!! I HOPE THESE FRAUDS GO OUT OF BUSINESS FOR STEALING 100.00 DOLLARS FROM ME!!! No company is too big to fall!! I regret ever considering using Utaxi. Lesson learned.",-1
6119,10/23/17,"Myself & my daughter travelled on 22/10/2017. We checked Utaxi from Kompally to Gachhibowli and the amount shown is Rs.339 only. When the driver dropped us he has shown an amount of Rs.1324.27 which is not all correct. I have verified the receipt which is showing an amount of Rs.339.40 plus wait time Rs.3.22 total 342.62 but cash receipt has come for Rs.1324.47. How it is possible. It is possible if the driver continues from the previous trip. How the total of Rs.339/- has become 1324? Please explain. I have travelled with my daughter & hence I paid only Rs.500 after prolonged discussion (no use from your Customer care in spite of contacting). So, tell me what nonsense is going on.",-1
6120,10/23/17,"I received e-mails from Utaxi asking me why I do not take Utaxi anymore. There is no way to reply to - they only SEND emails, they DO NOT ACCEPT e-mails.1. AUTOMATED customer service is the biggest problem of Utaxi. That is the first reason for which I stopped taking Utaxi. I tried to call Utaxi when in need. I found with difficulty a number on the web. I called it and a stupid message said: ""Don't bother leaving a message, there are 20,000 messages in this mailbox"". Whoever left that message was a major $#*!, Probably Travis Kalanick or one of those cocky bastards that Utaxi has plenty of.2. Utaxi VERY POOR customer service has cost me $ 650. In May 2016 I forgot my new iPhone ($650) in the Utaxi and there was NO WAY to retrieve it - there is NO Utaxi phone customer service where one can talk to a live person and explain the problem.That's a big flaw. I called Utaxi automated customer service from a hotel and never received an answer. I e-mailed multiple times, I left feedback over the Utaxi website. I received a response only TWO DAYS afterwards. Of course, TWO DAYS afterwards my iPhone was long gone. That is why Utaxi poor customer service has cost me $ 650. Utaxi has not offered me any compensation for that - and THE SAME THING can happen again. 3. The cars are often dirty. I initially switched from taxis to Utaxi because I cannot stand taxis that are dirty and smell of food because the driver eats in there. However over time the Utaxi has started being just as bad. There is no quality control of car. I have had dirty Utaxi cars, or banged up Utaxi cars or drivers that couldn't follow a GPS and took much longer than they should have. The dirtiness is by far the biggest problems.
  In contrast, Be-taxi has CLEAN cars. It enforces cleanliness.4. I do not care about the negative press that Utaxi has had. However, I do care very much about:
  - the car being CLEAN, with NO FOOD SMELL
  - the driver that knows how to drive and follow a GPS.
  - your having an ACTUAL customer service. It is impossible to e-mail Uer - though Utaxi DOES send email to you. Until Utaxi solves these problems, I will no longer take Utaxi cars. I will go to Be-taxi and other competitors, every time.",-1

The Utaxi driver did not have to wait even one minute. In fact, it was I who waited for the Utaxi driver to show up. Manhattan, NY - October 6, 2017: I was charged a ""waiting fee"", even though I was standing precisely at the GPS location from which I requested the ride and at which the Utaxi driver picked me up.

And 10 blocks from our theater destination he took another wrong turn and ended up in New Jersey. By the time he got back to Manhattan it was already past the starting time of the play we were going to. As a matter of fact it was already 30 minutes into the play.",-1

Upon exiting, the driver was outside with my phone. I had dropped it in her car and she returned it. I was very grateful. Return home was $7.15 and $5 tip (a different driver). Checked my bank account when I got home, was charged total of $48.84. Registered concern in the app. There is no customer service phone number. I was sent a message that I was charged $15 for returning my phone. Still a discrepancy. I replied and my concerned was totally dismissed. Message said complaint was resolved. Terrible service. No more Utaxi for me.",-1

6128,10/18/17,"This is a complaint about a trip on 28.9.17 ordered at 8.25 a.m. Eastern time in Boston. The expected arrival time delayed a lot, 3 min, 6 min, 9 min, 4 min and so on. Then after approx 12 minutes a message came that Driver ** has cancelled the trip! For reference: the surcharge when booing was factor 1.4. Then my host Jennifer booked for me, meanwhile the surcharge was 2.4. I finally arrived with much delay at the railway station. The driver just cancelled since he expected more profitable trips to perform during that time. This practice was confirmed by another Utaxi driver in Boston when I openly talked with him. On top of all they charged me 5 USD for cancellation. I did not cancel. Finally Utaxi paid me back only the 5 USD cancellation fee, they did not refund me the approx 15 USD loss being the difference between factor 1.4 and 2.4.",-1
6129,10/16/17,"Utaxi drivers in Sydney (and other cities around the world ) have a bad habit of accepting jobs from miles away and sometimes up to 20mins, while still dropping off a passenger and while there are dozens of cars very close to the new job location. I had one this morning again to take me from home in Rushcutters Bay to work in the city and there were at least 6 cars within 1-2mins from my location. This the ** Utaxi driver, still took the job while still in the city some 15mins away. Utaxi needs to do something about this sort of behaviour as it ruins the customer experience and make people angry, if customers want ** service they would take a cab. The solution could be very simple, offer a function on the app for the users to manage a circular area around the pickup zone beyond which Utaxi drivers are excluded from picking up rides. Simple!!",-1
6130,10/13/17,"My experience with Utaxi was in San Francisco in April 2017. Utaxi is still hiding in the shadow and will not come up front and center to pick you up, they lurk around the corner, and if the wait too long for you they cancel the ride. This is a damaged game of hide and seek.",-1
6131,10/13/17,"It was completely outrageous when I called Utaxi to pick me up at the airport and bring me back home. They gave me the same service from my home to the airport three days prior to my arrival in town. To my surprise they charge me $58 for the same travel time and distance that I paid $23 before. The same service, the same distance, the same location. Never again request other services and never again will request their services.",-1
6132,10/12/2017,"I use Utaxi all the time, but I am officially done with this unprofessional company. Guess it would be a crime to be able to talk to someone in person at Utaxi. Utaxi is letting their drivers ripoff their riders. I have a service dog and in the last weeks have been charged twice a cleaning fee, without any input. The last one was for dirt spots on the seat that was already there. I am tired of drivers making extra money, whenever they feel like it. I am done being ripped off!!!",-1

6139,10/10/2017,"Utaxi Atlanta Horrible - I did Rideshare. The driver confused me with the other person that took the ride. I requested to be picked up from the Aquarium and go to Mary Mac's Restaurant. If you look at where the driver took the client it was not to that place. Utaxi charged me $4.77 for a ride I never took and believed the driver over me. Rideshare should not be used If you can't account for who took the ride. I was never picked up, the driver simply confused me with the other person. I had 3 rides scheduled but only picked up one time. Unfortunately, because of their growth, there's no way to account for what is real and not. I had the same problem in Washington D.C. but was able to get refunded.",-1

On the way to my dropoff, the driver picked up another passenger, dropped that passenger off. He proceeded to my dropoff, but he ended my ride by mistake. The driver had to load my dropoff address again. It's only after I got out the car, I realized my fare was duplicated. I've sent emails to Utaxi. They dont have customer relations, only email. They didnt refund me my money. On October 6, I used their service again. This time my fare was $30.92. This fare was obviously deducted from my Visa card and its also on my statement. On their app, Utaxi is claiming I have an outstanding payment, but I have PAID THEM. I need help.",-1
6146,10/07/2017,Utaxi charged me again for a wait time when I was outside waiting for the driver to pull up. Today I watched the driver pull up and got into the car. I even texted the driver my location beforehand so there would be no confusion. Then I look at my online receipt and I see the charge. This is the third time Utaxi has done this. I think it is a scam. I rated the driver really low and will change it once someone verifies that the drivers aren't responsible for this. I can't get anybody on the phone. Utaxi's customer service is atrocious. I can't keep using a service that tries to scam me at every opportunity.,-1

I managed to submit my complaint with them online. They took about two hours to come back. A Mr ** told me I must check that the reverse the money back into my account, which is not true. They only reverse the amount which they would've charged me for the trip but not the cancellation fees. I sent Mr ** an email again and told him that I was not reimbursed with the cancellation fees.

You will never have the same support rep even for the same case so there is no accountability or structure. It's quite unbelievable on all levels on how bad it is. At least as a writer you can dispute a credit card charge. But as a driver Utaxi can cheat you out of money and get away with it. I am a victim.",-1
6166,10/01/2017,"I noticed that when I Googled Utaxi, they were giving free rides to new customers so I downloaded the app and attempted to add a payment method. I'm disabled therefore I receive my money on a prepaid (if you will) government debit card. The card is issued through the Bank of America from the government of the United States and Utaxi will not allow it as a form of payment, nor will they allow me to use my PayPal account which is attached to said debit card. I find this extremely prejudicial towards the disabled sect, as many of us cannot drive or even afford a car, making ride sharing a necessity. I've spoken to Utaxi drivers who find the map app to be incorrect quite often, getting them lost and making them late. They also find the politics of the company deplorable.",-1

I have tried a lot to contact them to resolve the problem, at the end, they said it's more than 7 days and they cannot solve this problem!!! There is no phone number to contact and I am very upset with what they charged my credit card. I will never use this service again. Shame on Utaxi.",-1
6169,10/01/2017,"I have been a loyal user of Utaxi and it has always been my go-to means of getting from point A-B. But today, I've officially withdrawn and deleted their app. Heres why:
  Two nights ago, I've ordered a cab for my girlfriend to get home after a huge argument around the time of 3 a.m. Keep in mind her phone died at the time. Her destination was from Manhattan to Brooklyn. The next day, she had told me she was dissatisfied with a pool customer who gave her an attitude and told my girlfriend to ""shut up"" after talking to the driver named Raja. She was tremendously upset to begin with and it caused her to get off the car a few blocks later, which took her to the 1 train. We are super easy going people and we have discovered the driver Raja, has NEVER ended the trip at the time she was dropped off- which was only 5 blocks later and had fully taken advantaged of the circumstances and drove an empty passenge car to her destination in Brooklyn. I did not fully realize this until it was too late - so I had rated him 5 stars before I got the chance to report him. Again we were in an argument so we didn't not talk until a day later.
  First of all she and I were not drunk at all. And I have reached out to Utaxi and they have refused to refund me for the amount of $27. Although the money is not the issue but the dishonest driver. I will be going to Be-taxi from now on. I do not regret my decision.
  Also I notified Utaxi and told them the details and these illiterate workers reviewing my complaint do not even respond to the problem but are confusing that I want a refund because the fare amount itself is wrong. I regret to say that Utaxi hires lousy drivers that take advantage of customers at 3am. and if they had looked into my transaction profile, I already spend quite a lot for cabs, theres no reason for me to go beyond for 27$ unless it was the truth",-1
6170,9/30/17,"I have had several instances recently where I go to order and Utaxi tells me it's 2-3 minutes and then I confirm the order and it's 8-10 minutes (tech glitches). I have also had drivers who can't speak English and I must tell them where to go despite them having their map app on their phone available to them. Incompetent drivers and failing technology are not ingredients for a good user experience. When notified of their failings, Utaxi curtly replies that they work hard to provide the best user experience. Really, that's your best?",-1
6174,9/28/17,"They have the most jacked payment arrangements. They are willing to accept garbage such as Apple, Android, or gift cards to pay, but won't accept prepaid cards or American Express or Discover (mind you all of them you add money to). Use Be-taxi because they offer great discounts and they are more flexible & customer friendly. They truly want your business.",-1
6180,9/27/17,I'm not pleased with the Utaxi. They may project charges through one of my credit cards that they tried to refuse to remove but they were probably removed later on. Bye-bye credit card company. Also one of the drivers ran my wife over and broke her back in three places.,-1
6182,9/26/17,"I booked an Utaxi XL from our hotel to the San Francisco International Airport with a 9 a.m. pickup. The quoted fare was $44-$57. Our hotel offered to take us for $17 per person, but we opted to take Utaxi for the personal service and efficiency. We had an excellent driver and vehicle but when we arrived at the airport I discovered that Utaxi charged me $99.26! The worst part about Utaxi is that they make it so easy to book a trip but then they make it so difficult to contact them regarding any issues.",-1

So we thought being as they closed at 5:00pm,we probably wouldnt have to be here as long. It's now after 6pm and I had the time to write this review. Not only are we waiting for the longest, but every time we asked questions regarding the cars,no one seems to know what's going on. One of the workers said he's already off the clock and that he couldn't help. We further asked to speak with the manager and she was more unprofessional!!! She literally got pissed at one of the customers then claim ""she's doing us a favor"". I couldn't help but to let her know how unprofessional and very out of order she is...but she continued and even got mad at me also and shouting in her native language. DON'T COME HERE!!!",-1
6187,9/26/17,"I used Utaxi 6 times and twice They cancelled my order and charged me a $5 cancellation fee both times but it was Utaxi who cancelled, not me. There is no customer service so they just pocket the money. $10 is all they will ever steal from me.",-1
6188,9/25/17,"We were left STRANDED in rural Framingham MA, after dark, with no way to return to our hotel. My colleague is disabled and must use a cane. The evening which would have been memorable for many other reasons I am sorry to say will probably remain memorable because of Utaxi's actions. The problem all started when the driver showed up at our hotel, the Hotel Sheraton in Framingham, early on Saturday evening, September 24, 2017. We had dinner reservations for 5:30 that evening at a Framingham-area historic inn that both of us had been eagerly looking forward to visiting.",-1
6192,9/25/17,"I will and always have admitted, it's not about loyalty but business. I supported Utaxi in the past because they were getting the job done better than the cab companies. And in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry. However there are and will continue to be more rideshare business. Look what Napster did to the music industry and look where Napster is now? Utaxi has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand. I am on time for my driver, respectful (treating them the way I want to be treated), and despite not liking the tipping I still do it. I don't like the rating as it's pointless. If I give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly. Anything less than a 5/5 for a driver is ""wrong"". So the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score. Then there is this tipping which I have been in the service industry and support it but Utaxi was all about the no tipping and now if you don't tip enough or worse on time, the driver rates you poorly. Personally, I don't care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride, this is where the problem is.Some examples I dealt with is I had a driver in Montreal who didn't speak English and I did the best I could to communicate in French and so my rating goes down. In Phoenix, my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when I couldn't use his same thing. And most recently in Seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesn't know Seattle well. I had to end up using my own gps using international Data and yet now I get a bad review. I was scared to give this lady a 4/5 yet alone worse. And I have gained other example.I have supported Utaxi coming to Calgary and Edmonton, even when they were booted out temporarily. Now that I live near Vancouver, I was supporting them coming there as well. Now, I'm starting to change my mind.My point is now I'm considering going with other options including the awkward hailing of a cab! Regardless, ride sharing will continue to grow, the question is, will Utaxi be a part of this or eventually not exist like Napster, being just another company that started a trend?FYI they make it hard for you to contact them with complaints unless you say you were in an accident.",-1
6193,9/24/17,"I have used Utaxi 3 times. Once the driver got lost, causing me to miss my bus and costing me $60 extra fare. The other times were ok but I believe way overpriced. Sorry, not a fan.",-1
6199,9/23/17,"My son booked me an Utaxi to take me to the station to catch a train to the airport. When I got in the driver started going at about one mile an hour and drove up loads of little side roads, going round in circles in completely the wrong direction and wasting a good 15 minutes. When I told him I had a train and flight to catch he suddenly said he was looking for other customers because it was a shared ride. I rang my son who said it definitely wasn't shared and to tell the driver to get a move on. He refused to. I asked could he then change it to unshared and charge the extra and he said no. I asked him to call his superior and he said there was nobody there to call. I explained that if I missed the one train an hour I'd miss my flight and there wasn't another one for seven days. Effectively I'd lose my whole holiday. He shrugged and carried on at one mile an hour. There was nothing I could do and even if I'd got out of his car he'd taken me down such quiet roads there was no chance of finding another cab. This was 3am in the morning and eventually after much screaming on my part he gave up looking for sharers - but I made it to the station with two minutes to spare and had to to try and run up numerous platform steps with two pieces of heavy luggage. I will never forget the experience and will never ever use them again.",-1
6203,9/21/17,Drivers will accept then never show. This has happened over 7 times. I've only been riding with Utaxi for a few weeks. Utaxi has made me late work because they say they're coming and never show up and then won't cancel the ride on their end so the company charges my card for the ride that's didn't show and a cancellation fee.,-1
6205,9/21/17,"I waited through several drivers. I was in an unfamiliar neighborhood, but did describe my location adequately. When a driver finally showed up, he was hearing impaired; there was some difficulty making myself understood, but did make it to the airport in time, esp. as the flight was delayed. He drove quite fast, taking shortcuts. Made me a little concerned about safety.",-1

I trying to call him back and an automate it machine say that I have to call from my account phone number and the driver charge me for nothing, well my babies are late for school. I decide to request another car and in the map said 4 minutes. Well I thought maybe with this other car they can make it??? The driver (**) cancel literately in front of the building and this is not the right way they do business and treat your customer. And both were late - one for school and the other to college.

6218,9/17/17,"I just had a terrible experience with Utaxi pool. I ordered it for the first time yesterday on a route that I've taken many times before with UtaxiX. My phone is older, so the Utaxi app does not allow me to see the fare before requesting an Utaxi pool ride. However, I'd taken this ride so many times before with UtaxiX and the cost was never more than $50. I figured since Utaxi pool claims to be up to 40% cheaper that UtaxiX and it's a shared ride, I should be fine. Boy was I wrong! I ordered the pool and waited the estimated time but didn't see the car. I received no phone call either. Finally I noticed the car a half a block down past where I was standing. I went to the car and was told to get out because he had already cancelled. I was charged a $5 cancellation fee.",-1
6225,9/16/17,First of all you can't talk to anyone at Utaxi because they do not have phone support. After I finally found the online support team I asked why I was getting charged a monthly fee. I never opened an account with them. They did not know and continued to charge me even after I told them to stop. Instead my monthly bill got higher. They asked me to prove they were billing me by sending them screen snapshots and the last four of my credit card. Can you believe that? I had to prove to them that this was happening. So I did and then they asked me to give them the first 6 numbers on my credit card. Which I did. This company is either very incompetent or corrupt. I will never use their service!,-1
6226,9/15/17,New driver over 2 hours online - Trying to contact Utaxi is literally impossible. I was sent a delivery message which lasted approx 1 second and then disappeared. I then went on my first call and was unable to slide to commence the ride. When I did slide it I was virtually at the destination. Being unable to contact Utaxi to explain anything is a total waste.,-1
6233,9/14/17,I ordered an Utaxi today @ 9:45 for a 10:00 appt I had at the doc. At first I was told to walk over two blocks to meet the driver for my convenience. I waited around 15 minutes and kept on tracking the driver but no car showed up. After thoroughly checking the entire block I found him across the street. I quickly ran over but he informed me that my ride was cancelled and I'll have to order a car again. I did and they assigned me another driver (not this one) five minutes away. That driver canceled me after five minutes. I ordered another one but he never showed. I ended up walking the 1.2 mile to my appt. I will never use Utaxi again. They have absolutely no reliability and no customer service. I will try Be-taxi in the future.,-1
6234,9/14/17,"I had 4 guests (5 of us total) so ordered an Utaxi XL, which is advertised to seat 6 people. When I pulled up the order, I had the choice of an Utaxi X for $15 or an Utaxi XL for $35. Knowing that there would be 6 people with the driver, I ordered the Utaxi XL. When the car arrived, it was a small SUV (5 passenger vehicle) and the driver told us to ""squeeze in"". I have emailed Utaxi numerous times about this issue and have had no luck getting anything but an automated response saying that the issue has been resolved and that I should order an Utaxi XL for larger groups (which is what I did, but did not get an Utaxi XL). I have requested the $20 refund for the price difference with no success. It is not necessarily about the $20 - it is the principle. And it is also illegal for them to drive with 4 people ""squeezed in"" the back seat. It was embarrassing to me, as these were out of town guests. I do have 4 other witnesses that can verify the size of the vehicle.",-1
6238,9/14/17,There was an error in my billing causing me to believe my account was hacked. I cancelled my card and asked my CC company to reverse the charge. This is several months ago. To date I can get no response from Utaxi to confirm how much I actually owe them and my account is frozen.,-1

Customer Service has not been helpful and have yet to provide me with any documentation to support the adjusted fare. Utaxi has progressively gotten worse over the years, so this is the last straw for me. They need to understand that they are no longer the only low-cost option and improve their customer service.",-1

The procedure to get your $5 back that has literally been stolen from you is so time-consuming. It simply isn't worth the bother. I already had an unsatisfactory opinion of Utaxi - before all the HORRIBLENESS that they are today, June 13th 2017... So I'd say, try to catch a Be-taxi with someone else!",-1

I currently have a gift card on file on Sept 6 for 50.00 and some change. I took Utaxi to work that evening but when I got ready to request the ride home it stated I had an outstanding balance of 1.20 cent from my ride to work that evening. I thought that's not right.

I have never seen such behavior in my life. the moment you undertake the responsibility of a trip, you are taking responsibility for our time, safety and good service delivery and in return take payment from us. you cannot waste our time, compromise our safety and then put us through discomfort and finally say 'ok we won't charge you this time'. looks like Utaxi is no better than a bunch of scoundrels with no work ethics or standards.",-1

At least he could call back or e-mail us that he found or didn't find it.",-1
6298,8/15/17,"I finally caved and opened an account with Utaxi in order to take a ride from Hallandale to the Fort Lauderdale Airport to fly home. I was under the impression that the first ride was free, but I could not find the place to enter the code. Nevertheless, I was picked up and dropped off for a charge of $17.94. Once at the gate, I thought I would go back into the app and learn about it, and perhaps discover where to enter promo codes. That's when I saw that a second charge of $97.94 had been applied. To make a long story short, and after a number of back and forth emails with Utaxi, it seems that my driver Yuniel, who could not speak a word of English, claimed that my dog (which I do not have) had urinated all over his seats. The Utaxi reply after the fourth email included photos.",-1
6299,8/14/17,"I live in San Francisco (city) and have been using Utaxi for about two years. About six months ago I had the first issue with two drivers that I had to report for violations. My score has always been 5 stars until then, but Utaxi is allowing drivers to leave a negative rating for riders that have reported them or left a negative feedback due to unprofessional, rude, dangerous behavior. My score dropped to 4.85 because of that. Yesterday afternoon I correctly and honestly paid for two seats (me and my spouse), and when the driver arrived the car only had one seat available. When we asked him to cancel the ride, he denied our request multiple times and stared at us in a creepy way. When he heard we were going to contact Utaxi immediately, he left us on the sidewalk with bags and kept on making us pay for a ride we weren't benefitting of.",-1
6300,8/13/17,"Utaxi charged my card for a ride that did not take place. I was notified by my bank of an Utaxi charge on a weekend during which I never left home. Attempting to contact Utaxi by phone, or submit a fraudulent statement via their website both proved impossible. The last Utaxi contact number would not recognize my phone number. Their website would not permit the required screen shot of the fraudulent bank transaction. Ultimately, I resorted to closing the card, reasoning if it happened once, it will certainly happen again. Shame on you Utaxi.",-1
6301,8/13/17,"First off. Almost impossible to try and find a way to send in a technical question. Once I got someone they totally misunderstood my issue. Then assigned it a ""RESOLVED"" tag (when it WASN'T!!!), then discontinued contact. NEVER HAD MY ISSUE RESOLVED AND NOW THEY WONT RESPOND. This company is WAY TOO DIFFICULT to deal with. Giving up. Just gonna stick with Yellow Taxis from now on.",-1
6302,8/13/17,"I ordered an Utaxi to get to an interview in Tempe and I live in Gilbert. I had the same Utaxi drive to and from the interview... David. On the ride there he charged me the normal amount. Then on the way back he charged me an extra 50$ for an ""accident"" in the car. There was no accident I was at an interview! I would love to know what I did. They make up accidents so that they can make more money. It is ridiculous. This is one of the worst company's to use. DO NOT USE THEM. Use Be-taxi they are way more trustworthy and will not cheat you and take your money!",-1
6303,08/12/2017,"I was recently in Seattle for a fun trip. Used Utaxi several times without a problem. But then all of a sudden they charged me $250 out of nowhere to which they never did respond. But thank God my bank denied that fee. Then I asked for a ride, they cancelled on me, yet said I was not at the location I requested, then charged me $5 for a cancelled ride, NOT!!! And trying to contact customer service is a joke, to say the least. I have not used Be-taxi yet but will now be checking that out. Utaxi is a big rip off be careful out there!!!",-1
6305,08/10/2017,"Attempting to schedule a ride with Utaxi using their app failed 6, 8 or more times because the app could not verify the card security code on the back of the three credit cards I had entered into the app. I was returning home from shopping with frozen goods and was relying on Utaxi to get home. After several failed attempts, I noticed that Utaxi had shifted into surge pricing and then into a still higher surge pricing. I finally was able to schedule a ride. However I believe I drove up my own rate because I had requested so many rides until the app took hold. I have asked Utaxi to investigate my concern and have not heard back from them, and my original message has been deleted.",-1
6308,08/09/2017,"For all there data, which is impressive, they have no idea or are just plain heartless, that taxis drive 19.1 mph. Which translates to $13.62 per hour. The same # all the other drivers mention. I am giving it up and I work mostly in the Hamptons, NY, where they raise the rate 60-70% to $22.31 per hour. People have no problem paying more ant the Hamptons rate should be the BASE rate. Basically this app sucks. I agree with a previous review that said you make pennies. Consider this, you drive 12 min to pickup, do a 5 min fare, and collect $3.67. BTW, you have no idea where you are going. So now you are 5 min further out of your way. Stay on the N. Fork (LI) and do garbage fares for $13/hr or drive to the S. Fork with nothing? Nobody tips, 8% of people. Sure it's in the app, but I could not find it for my fare in their phone. Sure you work the ""Surge"" 1.8X, wow, now you make $20 and hour and get a red light ticket/pulled over because you don't know where you are. Not to mention, you never work a surge for an hour because it disappears as you approach, they know you are coming. Therefore to make money, you turn off the app....no you don't make money or work that hour for a surge. BTW there are 1000 Utaxis around you at all times, watching the ants on the consumer app drives you nuts. Be-taxi shows you were they are at any location: another form of torture as it confirms your good spot is taken up by 23 Be-taxis (which is about 60% of the Utaxi fleet). 3 Long hauls to NYC for a ""Bro price"" which not only includes gas, but lunch too: 2:35 hours to make $82, or 1:05 to make $80 when picked up in the Hamptons. I complained about the 82 fare, Utaxi said it was Kosher: sure I dropped at LaGuardia AND MIDTOWN in rush hour, no worries. Sat night I earned $296 in the Hamptons, minus gas in 10 hours. I KNOW THE HAMPTONS and have driven taxis since '99 part time. This is what a good driver gets for driving 300 miles. Every night I drive is 250-300 miles. 1000's of miles add up. Utaxi will get you out of a financial jam, and I will use it on MONGO nights: Concerts/Labor day, but it sucks and they have no problem having it suck for the driver, evidenced by the fares. That's all I got...oh yeah, premium/select drivers do 10% premium fares (30% of their profit), but do 90% of the base x fare. So they make....$18 per hour to pay for their Mercedes:) or grind it into dust. XL Fares are few and far in between, unlike gas stations for my Yukon. My car was a Charger 25 mpg+. NO Money in it. As the last fare said, give this up...and wait tables. I did get $210 for the puker in my car from S.Hampton, same care I put my kids in.......delete the app is what I should do.",-1

Just email. I was charged double what was stated and my Utaxi account had me going to a different destination than what I went to. I emailed multiple times with a reply saying ""resolved"". That is the price. I don't think so. No one really read my complaints. I kept emailing until my last email said ""sorry your ride was more than 30 days out, closed"". I have emailed several more times with no response. Utaxi is right... always, they won't listen to you and customer support stinks! My 16 dollar trip as stated on the app was $33.00. Final!",-1
6312,08/08/2017,"Utaxi does not care about drivers and their vehicles!!! For most issues, they have people responding in the Philippines (initially they say ""We are offshore""), who are trained to use initially prepared ready texts. Those guys do not disclose any unique info like employee ID, ext., initials etc., imitate work on the issue, imitate care, imitate responsibility. Every time a different person responds under the veil of anonymity. You can't talk to a manager. Their system is designed to discourage drivers to resolve their issues, to confuse them and distance them. On top of all, Utaxi doesn't want to be sued. They want arbitration! Utaxi also doesn't like class action measures! How is this possible that in the USA the government allows an american corporation to play games with people and avoid responsibility?",-1
6313,08/08/2017,"ON 7/30/17 I was in Oregon alone on a trip at the University needing a ride to PDX to get home to CA. I chose Utaxi over Be-taxi because they had a driver available and the time of arrival worked for me, I was to arrive at 5:11 to the airport PDX which would have been plenty of time. But with him getting lost to me looking for gas. And me having to use the app to guide him to my pick up locations I ended up being 45minutes late which therefore made me miss my plane. I'm sorry. This is unacceptable from Utaxi, feeling helpless at the time and that was not what I was quoted. My time that you gave me was to ARRIVE at 5:11 to PDX that gave me 1:35 min to catch my flight I WAS 45 minutes late!",-1

They tell you to do this and do that and once you do it is still do not work! The Utaxi card is a scam! I really didn't want to put a star because it is 0 stars for me.,-1
6315,08/05/2017,I feel compelled to let people know they are not the only one seeing hidden charges show up after a ride. I recently was in Boston and actually ran down the street to get in the car early so the driver did not have to stop up further in heavier traffic and was charged a wait time charge? How the heck does that work? No response from Utaxi yet as just wrote to them. The driver was very nice and a good ride to my destination but that fee is so pumped up just to make more money and I was right at the door of the address I put in that Utaxi agreed to pick me up at for $14 ride.,-1

Please be caution, don't take the ride if the up front showing price on your Utaxi app is a rip off.",-1
6317,08/03/2017,"I have honestly lost track of the number of times I have had a frustrating experience with this company. It's got to be at least 10 at this point, within the past year. Each time I attempt to resolve the problem by contacting them through their website, as there is no option to speak with a human being. The process of attempting to communicate with them is, every single time, another giant frustration. I had decided to just stop using their services, as there are many better choices out there (thank you Be-taxi), but was recently enticed by an email I got offering unlimited $5 rides for a month. I decided to buy the ""pass"" for $5, which would then ""unlock"" the $5 rides. I just arrived home to see that I have been charged $17 for a ride which showed up in the app as being $5.

6320,08/02/2017,It's August 2nd here in Dallas Texas and it is raining very hard. I called for an Utaxi ride to go to an ortho appointment that I have at Parkland Hospital. I was involved in horrific accident in January and my leg was nearly severed and it was saved from being amputated. I've been in a wheelchair for months today was my first to leave the house without a wheelchair or a walker to go to an appointment. It was pouring rain and the driver pulled up.,-1

I was late for the appointment with my doctor because of that. She reported me to Utaxi as if I made racial discrimination remarks. NOT TRUE. I contacted Utaxi and demanded a meeting with the driver to clarify that offensive report. Utaxi never was able to sustain the driver's claim and eventually they opted to ignore my messages. Very disappointing experience.,-1

I left my iPhone in an Utaxi last Thursday in Bordeaux. I immediately tried to log in to my account and contact the driver but apparently, because I was in another country, they required I provide a verification code - which was sent to my phone, which was in the Utaxi driver's car. My friend, who is also an Utaxi user, contacted Utaxi through her app to file an inquiry on my behalf. We have no less than 10 emails from Utaxi customer service, a different person each time, asking me/her to file an inquiry online - which would always lead to the service sending a verification code to the phone.",-1

I asked him ""when there is lot of space why you hit my car?"" He replied saying, ""I want to go to the left edge of the road immediately so I hit your vehicle. If I hit your vehicle you will stop so I can go the left edge of the road to drop my passengers."" This is how the Utaxi drivers are. Utaxi is encouraging and teaching their drivers to hit and kill people in order to drop their passengers on time. We are on one way road. He at least does not know that it is one way. He says ""this is two way so I can go to any direction that I want."" Very strange people on earth. This is how the social responsibility of the Utaxi is. Great organization.",-1

I have now downloaded Be-taxi they seem to have better service,-1
6327,7/30/17,Utaxi car service is selective on certain customers in offering flat fare packages deals. If you're a customer that normally spends 15 or more you will never be offered it. I however was accidentally offered it with another 25% off all rides package and when I tried to accept that one it would not let me. I contact customer service they told me to prove it was offered which was really horrible to even go through and I screen shot it and sent it to them. They apologize and said they was sold out and I would receive it on the next month. Not. Again my friend that barely catch Utaxi was offered it again and I'm with this 25% mess. Utaxi get lost. They also give one price then when the driver gets lost hike your price. You have to screen shot it before the ride start.,-1
6328,7/29/17,Requested a Utaxi in Las Vegas. Was standing in front of the Utaxi designated pickup spot for hotel when ordered Utaxi. Contacted driver after waiting 25 minutes. He said I was at wrong spot hung up on me and cancelled my pickup and charged me. Utaxi refuses to refund that charge. I've contacted them several times and they send me the exact generic email saying no refund. Horrible customer service will never use Utaxi again.,-1
6329,7/29/17,"My first time experience with Utaxi was objectionable! Signed up as a first time rider with Utaxi under a promotion called Chase50. Offer was for 50% off for first timers for the first 2 trips thru July 31, 2017. Had a difficult time to get the first one honored and the second one was lamely refused. Their app is terrible! It willl not allow a promotion code to be accepted. Communication thru the app is rigid and tortuous and the usual 800 number in the charges description won't allow any incoming calls only refers you back to their app which is worthless. And to top it all the second driver's conduct and dress code was second rate to put it mildly. Thank goodness for Be-taxi which I have been using all along without any problems whatsoever. Their driver's professionalism is top rate. Even their promotions are automatic. I will erase Utaxi app not to use them ever again.",-1
6332,7/29/17,I waited at the same spot at the airport. Car was 7 minutes away. I waited for 15 minutes until the car arrived. Yet Utaxi charged me waiting time!! The charge was very small but this is a question of principle and honesty. Is this due to improper reporting by driver and if so how can I correct this erroneous reporting. If it is Utaxi making a mistake how can I get this corrected? It is very difficult to contact Utaxi about customer issues. I have been an avid Utaxi rider but from now on I will look for other options.,-1
6333,7/29/17,I used the Utaxi ride and secured Utaxi pool for the price of $18 and change. When I receive the receipt for the ride it was for $22 and change. I contacted Utaxi about the error and they insisted the price on the receipt was correct. This was clearly a case of price switching that Utaxi does not want to take responsibility for. Not to mention that the driver got lost several times using Utaxi's map system and I had to use the google app on my phone to get the driver pointed in the correct direction. Utaxi customer service was absolutely no help in this incident at all.,-1
6334,7/28/17,"I have had several issues with Utaxi especially their navigation when a 10 minute ride with any other service takes 25 minutes to an hour because of their application. I had my last straw yesterday as I requested an Utaxi that was three minutes away only to stand and wait for 25 minutes. Of course Utaxi only gives you two minutes to cancel so almost every time this is the case, the extra charge of almost a dollar is certainly a scam as they probably are adding this to many unknowing customers and making a lot of money on this. I don't always pay attention to the email receipts that come in.",-1

Instead the Utaxi app requested my son provide credit card info again. So, I finally caved and provided a credit card to my son as a back-up payment to satisfy Utaxi's request. They made such a mess in my account that the bank automatically shut my card down.",-1

This isn't fair- please check driver's phone or how he did it. And he didn't show me that he completed the trip and Once I got out of the car he did something on his phone. Same time I thought that something was wrong . now I can't trust Utaxi at all.
  They charged me four times the fare I was supposed to pay and they didn't even confirmed me .I was shocked to see the email of 401Rs.

6340,7/25/17,"First and foremost, in India there is no customer care service from Utaxi. There is just a help tab through which we can raise a complaint and that will be solved after 24hrs (taking their sweet time to respond).
  If a customer is in a deep trouble there is nobody to help. That pathetic ""HELP"" doesn't help actually.
  There were multiple issues I have faced with Utaxi. But, today it was disgusting. I got ill because of the $#*!ty freshener used in the cab. Apart from that driver had stopped the car in the middle, ended the trip and told me to get down at the unknown place because I was ill. And I was helpless because Utaxi has only ""HELP"" tab which doesn't work at all at the time of need. He denied to take me to the destination as he had some other work. when I insisted him he told I'll take you to the X place (where he had some work) and then I'll drop you to the destination. He forced me get down. I had to taxi from that place to my destination (Thanks to God I found a taxi over there), by the way I was charged for this trip which was equivalent to trip charge. Who is going to help in this.
  This is not the end yet. As the driver had ended the trip I was wrongly charged (more than what it is at time of booking) whose fault it was?? Driver was rude & abusive - Utaxi has ""HELP"" tab for your security.
  I have raised many requests on Utaxi ""HELP"" till now no help.
  One more important thing ""TIME"", nobody cares. Because of abrupt ending of the trip I reached my destination very late. Who is responsible??
  This is not the first time I was wrongly charged, it has become usual.

6355,5/13/13,"Utaxi has several problems that make it a poor experience for consumers IMHO based on my own experiences:1) Their drivers are not well-trained or carefully selected. As a result, some drivers don't know where they are going and are just bad drivers who would never be hired by a taxi company (which in my book is pretty bad). So your trip could take twice as long as it should, which means if you're late it's very hard to depend on Utaxi. 2) It costs a lot. Some fares depending on how slow your driver is could be twice as much as normal cab. They also use ""surge pricing"" which can increase the price of your fare. 3) Utaxi customer service has a bad attitude. Sort of like ""you're wrong, this is why we're right"". I'm not saying their customer service is worse than cab companies, but I am saying my experience with Utaxi customer service was poor. So in summation, Utaxi is a good idea, poorly executed. I'd try one of the other cab hailing apps in your city (Flywheel, Instacab, etc.) because you're likely to save money and have a better driver.",-1
