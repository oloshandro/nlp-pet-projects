The driver named swapnil picked me up from matunga at 9.45 and dropped me at powai. His car was from panvel. He was going to go without a passenger once I get down. The bill shown was 317 and he charged me 450. I gave him since I was in a hurry, instead I should have called my sister and confirmed. But is this ethically right? If I want to spend much money no matter how small or big the amount is I will do it all my will. I do not want such thugs around. Everytime overcharging.

5754,I requested a ride from Times Square to the Statue of Liberty. The rate was $26 and supposed to take 20 mins. There was a lot of traffic so I didn't think much of the long ride until I started to notice all the cars had New Jersey plates. We were in Hoboken because our driver had obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere. To make matters worse he spoke little English so he could not explain what was going on. At one point he turned onto an entrance ramp in error and tried backing up it. When that didn't work he turned around and drove the wrong way. When we finally got to the New Jersey side of the ferry I received the final fare from Utaxi at $77! When I filed a complaint they said I had input the wrong address so it's my fault we ended up in New Jersey and refused to refund me the fare.

This brought my credit balance to 13.50, one way ride was $6, therefore, I would have the $12 total to cover there and back, well I thought. On attempt to confirm ride home I had no credits remaining, even after the first ride receipt only showed $6. This left me stranded and having to walk 4 miles home because I had no more payment options. Contacted Utaxi via email when made it home. They gave me some dumb excuse about an authorization hold on an additional $6 to ensure there was enough on payment method to cover trip. Well first of all, this policy relates to debit or credit card use, and secondly, I've ride many times using gift cards and this never happened.

HOWEVER, in Nov and Dec of 2017 my account was hacked and fraudulent rides were clocked in in LONDON and PARIS while I was in the USA. First time it was 4 rides; last time it was 9 rides and it all added up quickly. Two of my CC were used in the process, necessitating my CC Company to shut down one of my main credit cards... what a hassle to deal with all that. Customer Service (once you got it) was great as they did reverse charges (so the only folks out of the money I would assume would be the drivers, unless Utaxi picked up the Fraud Tab). But Utaxi did charge me a ''fee'' for reversing charges, so I did not walk away completely un-bruised. I promptly SHUT DOWN my account and will find another Ride-Share service that is more secure.Utaxi has got some issues to work out... their CULTURE as recent news reports allude to but also a BETTER way (faster and easier) to alert corporate about big problems with the app and web site and FRAUD, etc. The system as it is now is elusive and painstakingly complex.4 Stars for the SERVICE & Riders; 1 Star for the Hacking = 2 stars total as my review/ranking.JP",-1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

 Why customers are charged cancellation charges when we cancel even after 2 mins, here driver cancelled after 15 mins!!! 
 Utaxi is a ridiculous company which is misusing customer data and leveraging the loop holes!!
 Utaxi should be banned in US and every customer whose personal info is leaked should be paid compensation!! Utaxi tracks every movement and claims its to improve trip experience!!
 My suggestion is first do a proper driver orientation and back verification, which will definitely improve customer experience!!!

6120,"I received e-mails from Utaxi asking me why I do not take Utaxi anymore. There is no way to reply to - they only SEND emails, they DO NOT ACCEPT e-mails.1. AUTOMATED customer service is the biggest problem of Utaxi. That is the first reason for which I stopped taking Utaxi. I tried to call Utaxi when in need. I found with difficulty a number on the web. I called it and a stupid message said: ""Don't bother leaving a message, there are 20,000 messages in this mailbox"". Whoever left that message was a major $#*!, Probably Travis Kalanick or one of those cocky bastards that Utaxi has plenty of.2. Utaxi VERY POOR customer service has cost me $ 650. In May 2016 I forgot my new iPhone ($650) in the Utaxi and there was NO WAY to retrieve it - there is NO Utaxi phone customer service where one can talk to a live person and explain the problem.That's a big flaw. I called Utaxi automated customer service from a hotel and never received an answer. I e-mailed multiple times, I left feedback over the Utaxi website. I received a response only TWO DAYS afterwards. Of course, TWO DAYS afterwards my iPhone was long gone. That is why Utaxi poor customer service has cost me $ 650. Utaxi has not offered me any compensation for that - and THE SAME THING can happen again. 3. The cars are often dirty. I initially switched from taxis to Utaxi because I cannot stand taxis that are dirty and smell of food because the driver eats in there. However over time the Utaxi has started being just as bad. There is no quality control of car. I have had dirty Utaxi cars, or banged up Utaxi cars or drivers that couldn't follow a GPS and took much longer than they should have. The dirtiness is by far the biggest problems.
  In contrast, Be-taxi has CLEAN cars. It enforces cleanliness.4. I do not care about the negative press that Utaxi has had. However, I do care very much about:
  - the car being CLEAN, with NO FOOD SMELL
  - the driver that knows how to drive and follow a GPS.
  - your having an ACTUAL customer service. It is impossible to e-mail Uer - though Utaxi DOES send email to you. Until Utaxi solves these problems, I will no longer take Utaxi cars. I will go to Be-taxi and other competitors, every time.",-1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Two nights ago, I've ordered a cab for my girlfriend to get home after a huge argument around the time of 3 a.m. Keep in mind her phone died at the time. Her destination was from Manhattan to Brooklyn. The next day, she had told me she was dissatisfied with a pool customer who gave her an attitude and told my girlfriend to ""shut up"" after talking to the driver named Raja. She was tremendously upset to begin with and it caused her to get off the car a few blocks later, which took her to the 1 train. We are super easy going people and we have discovered the driver Raja, has NEVER ended the trip at the time she was dropped off- which was only 5 blocks later and had fully taken advantaged of the circumstances and drove an empty passenge car to her destination in Brooklyn. I did not fully realize this until it was too late - so I had rated him 5 stars before I got the chance to report him. Again we were in an argument so we didn't not talk until a day later.
  First of all she and I were not drunk at all. And I have reached out to Utaxi and they have refused to refund me for the amount of $27. Although the money is not the issue but the dishonest driver. I will be going to Be-taxi from now on. I do not regret my decision.

And in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry. However there are and will continue to be more rideshare business. Look what Napster did to the music industry and look where Napster is now? Utaxi has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand. I am on time for my driver, respectful (treating them the way I want to be treated), and despite not liking the tipping I still do it. I don't like the rating as it's pointless. If I give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly. Anything less than a 5/5 for a driver is ""wrong"". So the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score. Then there is this tipping which I have been in the service industry and support it but Utaxi was all about the no tipping and now if you don't tip enough or worse on time, the driver rates you poorly. Personally, I don't care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride, this is where the problem is.Some examples I dealt with is I had a driver in Montreal who didn't speak English and I did the best I could to communicate in French and so my rating goes down. In Phoenix, my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when I couldn't use his same thing. And most recently in Seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesn't know Seattle well.

My phone is older, so the Utaxi app does not allow me to see the fare before requesting an Utaxi pool ride. However, I'd taken this ride so many times before with UtaxiX and the cost was never more than $50. I figured since Utaxi pool claims to be up to 40% cheaper that UtaxiX and it's a shared ride, I should be fine. Boy was I wrong! I ordered the pool and waited the estimated time but didn't see the car. I received no phone call either. Finally I noticed the car a half a block down past where I was standing.

They asked me to prove they were billing me by sending them screen snapshots and the last four of my credit card. Can you believe that? I had to prove to them that this was happening. So I did and then they asked me to give them the first 6 numbers on my credit card. Which I did. This company is either very incompetent or corrupt.

I complained about the 82 fare, Utaxi said it was Kosher: sure I dropped at LaGuardia AND MIDTOWN in rush hour, no worries. Sat night I earned $296 in the Hamptons, minus gas in 10 hours.

  If a customer is in a deep trouble there is nobody to help. That pathetic ""HELP"" doesn't help actually.
  There were multiple issues I have faced with Utaxi. But, today it was disgusting. I got ill because of the $#*!ty freshener used in the cab. Apart from that driver had stopped the car in the middle, ended the trip and told me to get down at the unknown place because I was ill. And I was helpless because Utaxi has only ""HELP"" tab which doesn't work at all at the time of need. He denied to take me to the destination as he had some other work. when I insisted him he told I'll take you to the X place (where he had some work) and then I'll drop you to the destination. He forced me get down. I had to taxi from that place to my destination (Thanks to God I found a taxi over there), by the way I was charged for this trip which was equivalent to trip charge. Who is going to help in this.
  This is not the end yet. As the driver had ended the trip I was wrongly charged (more than what it is at time of booking) whose fault it was?? Driver was rude & abusive - Utaxi has ""HELP"" tab for your security.
  I have raised many requests on Utaxi ""HELP"" till now no help.
  One more important thing ""TIME"", nobody cares. Because of abrupt ending of the trip I reached my destination very late. Who is responsible??
  This is not the first time I was wrongly charged, it has become usual.

As a result, some drivers don't know where they are going and are just bad drivers who would never be hired by a taxi company (which in my book is pretty bad). So your trip could take twice as long as it should, which means if you're late it's very hard to depend on Utaxi. 2) It costs a lot. Some fares depending on how slow your driver is could be twice as much as normal cab. They also use ""surge pricing"" which can increase the price of your fare. 3) Utaxi customer service has a bad attitude. Sort of like ""you're wrong, this is why we're right"". I'm not saying their customer service is worse than cab companies, but I am saying my experience with Utaxi customer service was poor. So in summation, Utaxi is a good idea, poorly executed.
